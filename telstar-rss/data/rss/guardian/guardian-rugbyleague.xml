      <title>Kalyn Ponga snubs Dolphins after being sold on Knights’ vision</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/21/kalyn-ponga-newcastle-knights-contract-nrl</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Star fullback commits to Newcastle with five-year deal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Origin player says he weighed up move to NRL’s 19th club&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kalyn Ponga gave lengthy consideration to joining Wayne Bennett at the Dolphins before ending fevered speculation about his future by signing a new five-year NRL deal with Newcastle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ponga’s new contract will keep him at the Knights until the end of the 2027 season. The 24-year-old had been heavily linked with a move to join Bennett at the Dolphins ahead of their entry to the competition in 2023.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/21/kalyn-ponga-newcastle-knights-contract-nrl"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>American dream: when Australian sport tries to crack the US market</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/american-dream-when-australian-sport-tries-to-crack-the-us-market</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman could be key in taking an NRL game to the US, but it would not be the first time an Australian code has made the journey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NRL could be on the verge of an American Dream, a season opener with the potential to make rugby league relevant in the United States. The competition has reportedly revived discussions about staging a historic premiership game between Manly and South Sydney in Los Angeles to open the 2023 campaign. Clubs will be banking on the Hollywood pull power of Rabbitohs owner Russell Crowe and Sea Eagles supporter Hugh Jackman three years after plans in 2019 fell through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is not the first time Australian sports have tried to gain exposure and relevance in the lucrative US market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/american-dream-when-australian-sport-tries-to-crack-the-us-market"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Jack Sinfield unable to provide a spark as Leeds are sunk by Castleford</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/18/castleford-tigers-leeds-rhinos-super-league-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Castleford Tigers 16-14 Leeds Rhinos&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Son of Kevin Sinfield makes pro debut for struggling Leeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second half of Super League’s gruelling Easter double-header is rarely short on narrative. With clubs playing three times in little more than a week there is the potential for seasons to be defined, one way or another. That certainly felt the case as Castleford and Leeds played out a contest riddled with tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day when Jack Sinfield, son of the legendary Rhinos and England captain Kevin, made his professional debut at the age of 17, the long-held belief at Headingley that he can help be part of a new dynasty of success at Super League’s most successful club will have to wait for now. There are more pressing matters for Leeds to deal with, such as the fact that with more than a third of the regular season gone, they are in the thick of a relegation battle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/18/castleford-tigers-leeds-rhinos-super-league-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘There’s help in place’: does rugby league have a drugs problem? | Aaron Bower</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/18/theres-help-in-place-does-rugby-league-have-a-drugs-problem</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After Jamie Acton said players who had not taken drugs were ‘abnormal’, the sport is asking itself some hard questions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamie Acton could not have been clearer. “You’re probably abnormal in the rugby league world if you haven’t taken drugs at some point, whether that is socially or performance‑enhancing,” the former Leigh forward said this year when he revealed he had taken drugs throughout his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rugby league is certainly not immune to drugs; to suggest otherwise would be irresponsible. But Acton’s claim that a player was “abnormal” if they had not been involved with drugs raised the question of just how much the game had overlooked the issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/18/theres-help-in-place-does-rugby-league-have-a-drugs-problem"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>More than 400 ex-rugby players died early from brain injuries, claim lawyers</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/16/more-than-400-ex-rugby-players-died-early-from-brain-injuries-claim-lawyers</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firm taking action against RFL refers to brain damage ‘epidemic’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;‘Immediate’ changes needed to protect players in both codes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawyers working with more than 75 former rugby league players to take legal action against the Rugby Football League – as well as 175 former rugby union players in a similar action – believe that potentially more than 400 players from both codes have died early due to neurological defects from playing the game and have reiterated the need for the league to make “substantive, immediate changes” to prevent further players from suffering the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group including the former Great Britain international Bobbie Goulding have launched a lawsuit against rugby league’s governing body over what they say is a failure to protect them adequately from the risks of brain damage caused by concussive and sub-concussive injuries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/16/more-than-400-ex-rugby-players-died-early-from-brain-injuries-claim-lawyers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>St Helens win one-sided derby as Mark Percival piles misery on Wigan</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/st-helens-win-one-sided-derby-as-mark-percival-piles-misery-on-wigan</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;St Helens 22-4 Wigan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jai Field’s try gives visitors early lead before hosts hit back&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are faced with opposition on the level of this St Helens side – arguably the best of the modern era, though that is a discussion for another day – it is those little glimmers of hope which hurt the most. By the end, Wigan’s race in the latest instalment of rugby league’s richest rivalry had long since been run, with a ninth defeat in 10 against their greatest foes from across the Billinge Hill somewhat of a formality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final scoreline underlines the dominance St Helens have on everyone else in Super League, and that includes a Wigan side who are almost certainly their greatest obstacle to a fourth consecutive title as things stand. Yet it is just how ruthless the reigning champions are when their backs are against the wall which sets them apart. Wigan had played their part in a thrilling opening quarter, and arguably even deserved to take the lead in front of a sellout crowd of 17,980.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/st-helens-win-one-sided-derby-as-mark-percival-piles-misery-on-wigan"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nathan and Ivan Cleary deals set Panthers up for long-term success</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/cleary-deals-set-panthers-up-for-long-term-success</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With five-year contract extensions the father-son duo can build the dynasty Penrith have always craved&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penrith’s ultimate successes have, historically, been fleeting. Not this time. The signing of star halfback Nathan Cleary and coach Ivan Cleary to long-term deals has set the Panthers up for sustainable security at the top of the premiership ladder. This may not be Melbourne Storm longevity but it is hard to see Penrith missing out on the top four anytime in the 2020s now the Clearys have locked themselves in as centrepieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid a great deal of controversy in 2019, Nathan Cleary was reunited with his father Ivan, who left the Wests Tigers in acrimonious circumstances to return to Penrith for his second stint as head coach. It led to Phil Gould’s departure as Penrith’s executive general manager and left a great deal of angst among the Wests Tigers faithful that the driver of the bus had ditched the joint. It did net a remarkable third premiership for the Panthers last year though, the golden generation realising their potential.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/cleary-deals-set-panthers-up-for-long-term-success"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Brother versus brother’: Super League revels in first all-French derby</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/14/super-league-revels-in-first-all-french-derby-catalans-toulouse</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The sense of occasion and knock-on effects will resonate much more than Catalans’ hard-won victory over Toulouse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost exactly 27 years to the day since the former chief executive of the Rugby Football League, Maurice Lindsay, unveiled the grand plans for the advent of Super League and the proposed continental expansion which came with it, few should have afforded themselves a smile more than Lindsay here as history was made, with two French sides facing one another in the competition for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original plans for the first Super League season in 1996 included two French teams, Toulouse and Paris. That ultimately never materialised, with Toulouse not making it to the start line and Paris Saint-Germain lasting barely a couple of seasons. But here, the vision and belief so many traditionalists laughed at for years, the notion that two French teams could stand side by side in the elite competition, finally came to fruition as Catalans hosted Toulouse: and it was a moment for all of rugby league, not just those in France, to savour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/14/super-league-revels-in-first-all-french-derby-catalans-toulouse"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Can’t I be anti-Nato in the Labour party? | Brief letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/cant-i-be-anti-nato-in-the-labour-party</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keir Starmer’s rebuke to Jeremy Corbyn | Ukraine’s white storks | Coronation Street’s silent character | Vladimir Putin and Gellert Grindelwald | Rugby league coverage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am appalled at the apparent suggestion that it is not acceptable for a Labour party member to be opposed to Nato (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/11/jeremy-corbyn-will-not-have-labour-whip-restored-starmer-suggests" title=""&gt;Corbyn will not regain Labour whip while endorsing Stop the War, suggests Starmer, 11 April&lt;/a&gt;). I distinctly remember speaking against Nato at a national conference of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in the late 1960s, and that view has never changed. I have been a Labour member since 1971 and I have never had any indication from the party that that view was inconsistent with membership.&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simon Fowler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lamberhurst, Kent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• It was refreshing to read Oleksandr Ruchko’s piece from Lviv (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/14/country-diary-to-ukrainians-the-storks-return-is-a-glimmer-of-hope" title=""&gt;Country diary, 14 April&lt;/a&gt;), and to hear of the white stork, the national bird of Ukraine and a symbol of freedom. It brought to mind folk songs of the Tchyka bird, a poetical name for Ukraine itself.&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Salt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;London&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/cant-i-be-anti-nato-in-the-labour-party"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Union head Garreth Carvell wants ‘proper rest’ between games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;‘Throwing them into three games in nine days isn’t safe’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The traditional Easter double-header this year could be the last time fans get to experience one of the highlights of the Super League calendar amid a player-led push to improve welfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rugby League Players Association, which represents professional rugby league players in the UK, has held talks with the Rugby Football League to bring an end to periods such as Easter – during which many Super League players endure two games in 72 hours and three in as few as nine days – from as early as next season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/13/rugby-league-players-union-calls-for-easter-double-headers-to-be-dropped"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>After years of slow growth, Super League crowds are finally booming</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2022/apr/13/super-league-crowds-wigan-saint-helens-warrington</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sold-out grounds are increasingly common and there will be more full houses for Easter Rivals Round this weekend&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gavin-willacy"&gt;Gavin Willacy&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/nohelmetsrequiredbook"&gt;No Helmets Required&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s taken seven years, but Super League may be about to tick off a key performance indicator. In 2015, the Rugby Football League said they wanted to sell out 10 games a season. Until this year, you could count sold-out fixtures on one hand. But as the Easter Rivals Round arrives, the RFL are rushing towards their target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castleford filled their 10,500 spaces for their season-opener against Salford, and broke 10,000 again against Hull FC. Hull KR sold out last week’s game with Warrington and Craven Park will again be full for the derby on Good Friday, when a capacity 17,980 is also expected to see the top two – Saints and Wigan – meet in St Helens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2022/apr/13/super-league-crowds-wigan-saint-helens-warrington"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sydney Roosters 16 defeated St George Illawarra 4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;‘Comeback Queens’ chase down Dragons to win first title&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sydney Roosters have won the 2022 NRLW premiership, vanquishing the demons of NRLW grand final losses in 2018 and 2020, to come from behind and defeat St George Illawarra 16-4 at Moreton Daily Stadium in Redcliffe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dragons opened the scoring the first time they took possession in the second minute. Emma Tonegato’s fast catch-and-pass found winger Madison Bartlett on the fly. The Kiwi national, who was suspended in March on a biting charge, crossed in the corner to give the Red V an early 4-0 lead. Bartlett’s eighth four-pointer of the season extended her lead as the record try-scorer in NRLW history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/sydney-roosters-defeat-st-george-illawarra-to-win-maiden-premiership"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Challenge Cup holders St Helens beat Catalans Dragons in dominant display</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/catalans-st-helens-challenge-cup-rugby-league-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quarter-final: Catalans 20-36 St Helens&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blistering spell in first-half put Saints in control&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;St Helens took another step towards retaining the Challenge Cup courtesy of a commanding victory. The Super League champions were handed arguably the toughest draw of the quarter-finals, with a trip to Perpignan to face the Dragons in a ferocious atmosphere in the south of France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as they have done so many times in recent years, they reserved one of their best performances for when it truly mattered. What looked a daunting task was navigated with some comfort as they progressed to next month’s semi-finals at Elland Road at the expense of the side they defeated in last year’s Grand Final.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/catalans-st-helens-challenge-cup-rugby-league-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Tommy Makinson doubles up as St Helens extend Leeds’ poor start</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/01/tommy-makinson-doubles-up-as-st-helens-extend-leeds-poor-start</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leeds 0-26 St Helens&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visitors run in five tries in comfortable win&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a moment here, with over half an hour remaining, which perhaps summed up the current plight Leeds Rhinos find themselves in. At that stage, the hosts trailed by only eight points and a try would have brought them back into a contention against a St Helens side who certainly weren’t at their exhilarating best. A penalty deep in Saints territory offered them a prime opportunity to attack but instead of holding their nerve, Leeds panicked, shifted the ball wide on the first tackle and were bundled into touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is the hallmark of a side who are low on confidence, and a quarter of the way through the regular season, in real trouble at the bottom. On the night of James Roby’s 500th St Helens appearance – only the fourth man in the club’s history to reach that milestone – the 36-year-old will have not had many more straightforward nights at the office than this, as the reigning champions inflicted a sixth defeat in seven league games on the Rhinos in 2022 without really getting out of second gear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/01/tommy-makinson-doubles-up-as-st-helens-extend-leeds-poor-start"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Compelling storylines abound as Panthers and Rabbitohs re-run NRL grand final | Nick Tedeschi</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/01/compelling-storylines-abound-as-panthers-and-rabbitohs-re-run-nrl-grand-final</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Latrell Mitchell chases inner peace while Nathan Cleary’s return signals the real start of Penrith’s pursuit of back-to-back titles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latrell Mitchell is unlikely to view Friday’s clash between the Rabbitohs and Panthers in a re-run of last year’s grand final as a chance to provide any kind of atonement but deep down the emotional fullback will feel an added responsibility to carry South Sydney on his broad shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitchell missed last year’s decider after he was suspended for six weeks following a shocking incident when Souths met rivals the Sydney Roosters. Mitchell aggressively hit former teammate Joey Manu high, leaving the mercurial Roosters centre with a facial fracture that ended his season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/01/compelling-storylines-abound-as-panthers-and-rabbitohs-re-run-nrl-grand-final"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘This is a big moment’: Cornwall opens up new frontier for rugby league | Aaron Bower</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/31/if-we-get-cornwall-right-were-way-beyond-rugby-leagues-heartlands</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new club representing the county make their professional bow in the RFL this weekend, with some players tasting the sport for the first time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very rarely will you have heard Namibian rugby union and Cornish rugby league mentioned in the same breath: but then again, very few people have a story to tell quite like Neil Kelly. The 59-year-old’s journey has taken him from the heartlands of rugby league, playing for clubs such as Featherstone and Wakefield with great distinction, to a coaching career that has included stints in Ireland, America and Namibia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Saturday, Kelly begins arguably the most intriguing challenge of his rugby career as he takes charge of Cornwall in their inaugural match as a rugby league club. They were founded last November after a successful bid acquired the professional licence initially earmarked for a Canadian franchise in Ottawa that never materialised, and the Rugby Football League’s approval of the Cornish bid marks the first time in history the region has had a professional rugby league team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/31/if-we-get-cornwall-right-were-way-beyond-rugby-leagues-heartlands"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Corey Hall try completes Wakefield’s Challenge Cup comeback at Warrington</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/27/warrington-wakefield-challenge-cup-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warrington 12-16 Wakefield&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trinity will play Wigan in quarter-finals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was John Kear, the rugby league coach who created Challenge Cup history with Sheffield Eagles in 1998, who described coaching as chaos, a sentiment Daryl Powell would certainly agree with right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three weeks, it appeared a seamless transition into the role of Warrington head coach for Powell, with three successive wins to start the new Super League season and his tenure at the club. But his exasperated reactions here as his side’s Challenge Cup hopes slipped away in excruciating fashion emphasised how the honeymoon period is now emphatically over for him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/27/warrington-wakefield-challenge-cup-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
