      <title>My husband has been in touch with an old flame. Should I confront him? | Ask Annalisa Barbieri</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/22/my-husband-has-been-in-touch-with-an-old-flame-should-i-confront-him</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being open and honest is the best way forward, but work out what you want beforehand and accept he may not provide it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In late 2020, during lockdown, I met a nice guy. We started dating and our relationship developed at a rapid pace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Six months into our relationship, I found an email &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;on his computer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; from his university sweetheart. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; When we first met, he had told me about her, and how, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 years before, he was in love with her and wanted to marry her, but his family disapproved. She later got married to someone else, and he moved on with his life. The email was a short correspondence about general things, nothing &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“out of line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/22/my-husband-has-been-in-touch-with-an-old-flame-should-i-confront-him"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Are you a beard guy? Tim Dowling on the trend that will never end</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/22/are-you-a-beard-guy-tim-dowling-on-the-trend-that-will-never-end</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fashion says we reached ‘peak beard’ a decade ago, but there are still so many around. Is it the pandemic – or is something else going on? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every morning I wake up slightly surprised that I still have a beard. It’s been there on my face for more than a decade, but I still don’t think of myself as being in any way committed to it. That’s because nothing about a beard involves commitment; I got it by doing nothing, and I could get rid of it tomorrow. Mostly, I don’t think about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when I do stop to consider it, I have to wonder how many favours it’s doing me. It certainly makes me look older, although shaving it off wouldn’t necessarily make me look younger: the face beneath hasn’t stopped ageing, and the last time I saw it – briefly, last summer – I was shocked by the settled weight of my expression. So the beard came back, only greyer this time. Which is better? A beard takes months to fill in. How could you even begin to compare the two looks, one against the other?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/22/are-you-a-beard-guy-tim-dowling-on-the-trend-that-will-never-end"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rukmini Iyer’s vegan recipe for cauliflower and almond soup with chilli oil and caper twists</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/feasting-with-ocado/2022/jan/10/rukmini-iyers-vegan-recipe-for-cauliflower-and-almond-soup-with-chilli-oil-and-caper-twists</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Roasting Tin author’s velvety vegan soup recipe will keep you warm until summer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is such a simple but delicious soup, based on one made by my friend Emily years back. The velvety cauliflower soup is a wonderful contrast to the heat of the chilli oil and crispy almonds, with crunchy caper twists to dip. It’s perfect to kick off an evening with friends, or as a warming lunch. Just use dairy-free puff pastry for the twists, such as Jus-Rol’s from Ocado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instantly shop all these ingredients from &lt;a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000096568&amp;amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-cauliflowerandalmondsoup&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=guardian-feast" rel="nofollow"&gt;ocado.com/cauliflowerandalmondsoup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/feasting-with-ocado/2022/jan/10/rukmini-iyers-vegan-recipe-for-cauliflower-and-almond-soup-with-chilli-oil-and-caper-twists"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Mildreds, London WC1: ‘Unapologetic and utterly un-preachy’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/22/mildreds-london-wc1-unapologetic-and-utterly-un-preachy-restaurant-review</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s no chummy mission statement about being kind to pigs or saving us from cow farts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, &lt;a href="https://www.mildreds.co.uk/"&gt;Mildreds&lt;/a&gt; had a niche appeal: meat-free and going strong since 1988, but not exactly mainstream. Your average diner liked vegetables, sure, but preferred them with a lovely steak. Or even a not particularly lovely steak, such as the ones served at the Covent Garden Angus Steakhouse, where tourists flocked for the 12oz ribeye and the Carolina chunky chips smothered in cheese and crisp bacon. Or at least they did until it was &lt;a href="https://www.hot-dinners.com/2022012611170/Gastroblog/Latest-news/mildreds-covent-garden-london"&gt;closed and replaced by a new and very busy branch of Mildreds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the Burger King on nearby Leicester Square also turned vegan for a month this year, serving plant-based Whoppers to constant queues. Plants, it seems, are coming for us all, although anyone who has seen The Day of the Triffids would be under no illusions about any of this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/22/mildreds-london-wc1-unapologetic-and-utterly-un-preachy-restaurant-review"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The people making a difference: ‘I started a food bank – and it changed my life’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/22/i-started-a-food-bank-and-it-changed-my-life</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In lockdown, restaurateur Tessa Lidstone made and delivered 2,500 meal boxes to vulnerable people. Now it is her turn to be treated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tessa Lidstone remembers the last meals she cooked before she had to close her Bristol restaurant &lt;a href="https://www.boxebristol.com/" title=""&gt;Box-E &lt;/a&gt;for the first lockdown. It was 14 March 2020, and the restaurant was rammed. The venue is tiny: just 14 tables in two repurposed shipping containers. “It felt like a scary time,” says the 40-year-old. “Everything was slipping away and beyond our control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the restaurant closed for the foreseeable, Lidstone got to thinking about how other people might be coping. “I felt isolated in the pandemic,” she says, “but I was so lucky: I had my husband and kids with me. I thought about all the people without a support network and how awful it must be to not have contact with anyone.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/22/i-started-a-food-bank-and-it-changed-my-life"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Can I make an ethical killing on the stock market? We ask an expert</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/22/ethical-killing-on-stock-market-we-ask-an-expert</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tariq Fancy, former global head of sustainable investing at BlackRock, on whether it’s too good to be true&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion of “sustainable investing” had a bumper year in 2021. Aligning investments with climate goals – no fossil fuel companies, for example – promises a good financial return, while benefiting the planet. But is it too good to be true? I asked Tariq Fancy – CEO of non-profit digital learning charity &lt;a href="https://learn.rumie.org/jR/about" title=""&gt;Rumie&lt;/a&gt; and ex-head of sustainable investing for investment company &lt;a href="https://www.blackrock.com/uk" title=""&gt;BlackRock&lt;/a&gt;. Last year Fancy publicly denounced sustainable investing as a “&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@sosofancy/the-secret-diary-of-a-sustainable-investor-part-1-70b6987fa139" title=""&gt;dangerous placebo that harms the public interest&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I read a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;claim recently – from &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;research led by &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aviva and Make My Money Matter – that &lt;a href="http://makemymoneymatter.co.uk/21x/" title=""&gt;turning your pension “green” is 21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://makemymoneymatter.co.uk/21x/" title=""&gt; times more powerful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;in cutting your carbon footprint than stopping flying, becoming &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vegetarian and moving to a renewable energy provider combined.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;That’s ludicrous. Our individual actions reduce real-world emissions. Selling shares in polluting companies does not – it just means someone else buys those shares and owns those emissions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/22/ethical-killing-on-stock-market-we-ask-an-expert"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Experience: I opened the world’s largest penis museum</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/22/experience-i-opened-the-worlds-largest-penis-museum</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few well-endowed humans have promised to donate theirs when they die&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of my life I’ve been a teacher in Iceland, where I was born. In the 60s, I did a postgraduate degree in Edinburgh, but in the 70s I settled into life as a history and Spanish teacher in Akranes, a town north of Reykjavík.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night in 1974, I was having a drink with my fellow teachers after school and playing bridge. The conversation turned to farming in Iceland – we were discussing how the industry finds a use for every part of the animal. Take lamb, for instance: the meat is eaten, the skin used for clothes, the intestines for sausages and the bones turned into toys for kids. Someone asked if there was a use for the penis, which made me recall how, as a child, I had been given a dried bull’s penis as a whip, to drive the animals out to pasture every day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/22/experience-i-opened-the-worlds-largest-penis-museum"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Making up for lost time: UK goes ‘out out’ after two-year break</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/uk-goes-out-club-bars-covid</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Optimism among club owners returns as under-25s hit the streets and bars of London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On any given Friday, Saturday or Sunday night, it’s likely Aly Meghani will be relishing in a night out in central London, where the clubs, pubs and bars have returned to their spirited state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 25-year-old content manager from Ealing has been going out more than usual since lockdown restrictions were lifted &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/boris-johnson-says-he-plans-to-lift-all-englands-covid-rules-a-month-early"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;. The reason? Making up for lost time, said Meghani, and the fear of missing out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/uk-goes-out-club-bars-covid"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Everyone should prep’: the Britons stocking up for hard times</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/22/everyone-one-should-prep-the-britons-stocking-up-for-hard-times</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether it be Covid, Brexit, the climate crisis or war in Ukraine, some are determined to be ready in case of the worst&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before the pandemic, some people were stocking up on essential items such as food and toilet roll, in anticipation of supply chain disruptions wrought by Brexit or a fundamental civilisational collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some stockpiled candles, matches and logs, and bought a wind-up radio for keeping in touch with the news. Others installed freezers and shelving in outbuildings in which to store food, and shifted a proportion of their savings into overseas accounts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/22/everyone-one-should-prep-the-britons-stocking-up-for-hard-times"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Work remote, get paid less? The battle dividing offices will define the future of work</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/12/remote-work-return-to-office-what-is-the-future-of-work</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mobility and freedom are the new prizes for the professional working class. But some companies fail to grasp the scale and sweep of change&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world of work was already quite sick before the coronavirus took hold, but the pandemic put rocket boosters on cultural change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see the impact of this in every metric around work: during &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/04/great-resignation-quitting-us-unemployment-economy"&gt;the Great Resignation&lt;/a&gt; of 2021, millions of American workers resigned en masse. Workers worldwide have declared that they would quit their jobs if not provided with flexibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/12/remote-work-return-to-office-what-is-the-future-of-work"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I couldn’t fly home for my father’s death, so his ashes had to fly to me | Nicole Melanson</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Nicole Melanson watched the postman walk away, she wondered if he had missed the sticker declaring her package ‘cremated remains’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father’s first and only visit to Australia was via airmail. Covid-19 had ripped through his US nursing home like wildfire, annihilating everyone in its path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t fly home for my father’s death, so his ashes had to fly to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. I knew they were on their way; I just didn’t know when to expect them. Thanks to online shopping, I was well accustomed to the unpredictability of delivery during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/10/i-couldnt-fly-home-for-my-fathers-death-so-his-ashes-had-to-fly-to-me"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I gave birth, then they put me in a coma: Grace Victory on surviving Covid and bonding with her baby</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/09/gave-birth-then-coma-grace-victory-surviving-covid-bonding-with-baby</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The YouTuber was admitted to hospital seven months pregnant and ended up in a coma. A year after she finally met her son, she talks about her incredible recovery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in a coma and on life support, Grace Victory had hallucinatory and terrifying dreams. She was sex trafficked. Doctors removed her legs. Her ovaries were operated on, and her children harvested. She woke up dead, in Reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was January 2021, and the 31-year-old influencer was in hospital with Covid-19. She remembers the dreams as vividly as if they were the plot of her favourite TV show. They’re “embedded in my brain”, Victory says, “as real memories. Being told it didn’t happen – it’s like, well, it did.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/09/gave-birth-then-coma-grace-victory-surviving-covid-bonding-with-baby"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Yes I’m late to the party, but supermodel Paloma Elsesser is my new catwalk crush | Jess Cartner-Morley</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/22/supermodel-paloma-elsesser-is-my-new-catwalk-crush</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Uptight for too long, the fashion world has finally elevated a plus-sized model to rock-star status&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paloma Elsesser is my favourite supermodel. Is it weird that I still have a favourite supermodel at 48? Maybe, I guess, but none of us gets to choose the pop culture we grow up with. I was 13 when Cindy Crawford first made the cover of British Vogue, and I had that picture taped to my bedroom wall, an altar to all-American sex appeal that would have been Elvis had it been 1956 not 1986. By the 1990s, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/models" title=""&gt;supermodels&lt;/a&gt; were everywhere, like footballers on the then-ubiquitous Panini stickers, and I pored over their glamorous names and brief, glorious careers. I loved Christy Turlington, so serene and graceful. There was Kate Moss, obviously, and, much later, that day in London when Stella Tennant came out of retirement to open a Victoria Beckham show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsesser is different, because she is plus-sized. She is the first non-skinny supermodel to steal my heart. She is not the first beautiful bigger supermodel – Ashley Graham scored her first Vogue cover in 2017 – but she is the first plus-sized cover girl who has fully embodied the rock-star persona of a supermodel. When Elsesser is on a catwalk, nobody in the room can look at anyone else, and she knows it. She’s not just my favourite model; she’s everyone’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/22/supermodel-paloma-elsesser-is-my-new-catwalk-crush"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ruffles, cut-outs and metallic fabrics: statement swimwear is here</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/22/ruffles-cut-outs-and-metallic-fabrics-statement-swimwear-is-here</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maygel Coronel and Johanna Ortiz lead the way in costumes for the poolside, not for doing 40 lengths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If, once upon a time, the swimwear packed in your suitcase might have been an afterthought – a bikini designed to max out a tan and lunchtime dip – it is set to become the main event of your holiday wardrobe this summer. Statement swimwear is here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this trend is not about the sort of swimsuits to do 40 lengths. In the same way that wider fashion has moved to a glamorous night-time look as we emerge from the pandemic, swimwear is the latest – perhaps more unlikely – category to have a moment of maximalism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/22/ruffles-cut-outs-and-metallic-fabrics-statement-swimwear-is-here"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Images shared on social media show virtually identical garments from the two outlets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese ultra-fast fashion website Shein has been accused of copying designs by high street rival Zara after dozens of images were shared on social media showing virtually identical garments from the two outlets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the video platform TikTok, the hashtags &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/zara-vs-shein?lang=en"&gt;#zaravsshein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/zaradupe?lang=en"&gt;#zaradupe&lt;/a&gt; – where users share the very similar items from Zara and Shein, often wearing them – have had 38.3m and 39.8m views respectively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/20/ultra-fast-fashion-giant-shein-accused-of-copying-zara-designs"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Discrimination was their brand’: how Abercrombie &amp; Fitch fell out of fashion</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/19/abercrombie-fitch-netflix-documentary-fashion-discrimination</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A revealing new Netflix documentary looks back on the highs of the fashion brand that dominated a generation before controversies dragged it down&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a millennial or have parented one, you know the look: advertisements with shirtless men, sculpted abs above low-cut jeans, a melange of thin and tan and young white bodies in minimal clothing. A store at the mall mostly obscured by heavy wooden blinders, music pulsing from within. Faded jeans and polo shirts in middle and high school, all featuring the ubiquitous moose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White Hot: The Rise &amp;amp; Fall of Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch, a new Netflix documentary on the ubiquity of a once zeitgeist-y brand’s limited vision of “cool” and its culture of discrimination, is easy catnip for adults re-evaluating the influences of their youth. The brand of barely there denim miniskirts and graphic T-shirts was “part of the landscape of what I thought it meant to be a young person”, the film’s director, Alison Klayman, told the Guardian. (Klayman, a millennial, grew up in Philadelphia.) That’s true for many US adolescents in the late 90s through the 2000s, as Abercrombie stores anchored most mainstream malls across America, including my hometown middle school hangout in the suburbs of Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/19/abercrombie-fitch-netflix-documentary-fashion-discrimination"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>15 of the best floral pieces to wear this spring – in pictures</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/17/15-of-the-best-floral-pieces-to-wear-this-spring-in-pictures</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From summer dresses to trainers, here’s our pick of the best florals to buy now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes, March winds and April showers bring forth May flowers. We’ve had plenty of inclement weather this spring, so let’s get to work on our florals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borrow a styling trick from the Oscars’ red carpet and sharpen your look with a crisp white shirt. Try Zara’s deep-cuff style (£29.99) tucked into a mini or midi skirt. For every day, style your florals with white trainers or pull out one accent colour from the print for your sneakers or jeans to match. Rixo’s pansy-print blouse looks great with jeans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/17/15-of-the-best-floral-pieces-to-wear-this-spring-in-pictures"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Recipes for Ramadan: Maryam Hanifi’s Afghani chicken and orange rice (narange palow)</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/23/recipes-for-ramadan-maryam-hanifis-afghani-chicken-and-orange-rice-narange-palow</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spiced with cardamom, this fragrant, colourful rice dish was handed down to Maryam Hanifi by her mother and grandmother&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hosting dinner events was an essential part of our household when I was a young. I grew up in Kandahar city in a predominantly Pashtun region of Afghanistan. My paternal grandparents were from tribal Pashtun areas in Afghanistan, and their families spread around the country. My mother’s side was more of a mix and my maternal grandmother was Iranian-born and raised in Tehran, so I really grew up with many cultures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was expected that women would cook while living in their parents’ house, and it was considered obligatory in preparation for marriage. My father was a doctor, so many people knew him and would unexpectedly visit our house for dinner gatherings. I remember my mother gladly accepting any guests and cooking up a storm for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/23/recipes-for-ramadan-maryam-hanifis-afghani-chicken-and-orange-rice-narange-palow"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Cocktail of the week: the Dog &amp; Gun’s Applejack – recipe | The good mixer</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/22/cocktail-of-the-week-the-dog-guns-applejack-recipe-rum-lime-ginger-beer</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A zingy, fruity pick-me-up with rum, lime and ginger beer that’s perfect for &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; time on a Friday evening&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something fresh, fruity and zingy for spring. The crisp finish on the rum goes really nicely with the apple and ginger, because it pairs with the fruity notes, rather than overpowering them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK readers: &lt;a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000100819&amp;amp;utm_source=guardian-feast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-recipe"&gt;click to buy these ingredients&lt;/a&gt; from Ocado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/22/cocktail-of-the-week-the-dog-guns-applejack-recipe-rum-lime-ginger-beer"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ravneet Gill’s recipe for a roasted hazelnut and banana cake | The sweet spot</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/22/roasted-hazelnut-banana-cake-recipe-ravneet-gill</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Find nice, ripe bananas for this dense, nutty teatime treat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ripeness of a banana can be the difference between a dense and a light cake. I used to work in a restaurant where they’d only use frozen banana puree in their famous banana cake because the risk of unripe fruit was too much to handle. Try to use really ripe bananas for this cake. If you’re in a rush, you can put them in a low oven in their skins for 10-15 minutes, then leave them to cool completely before mashing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK readers: &lt;a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000100820&amp;amp;utm_source=guardian-feast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-recipe"&gt;click to buy these ingredients&lt;/a&gt; from Ocado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/22/roasted-hazelnut-banana-cake-recipe-ravneet-gill"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>What wines to drink with a plant-based diet | Fiona Beckett on drinks</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/22/what-wines-to-drink-with-a-plant-based-diet</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many wines that match well with meat are just as good with vegetarian options – rather than focus on the main ingredient, it’s often more useful to think of the way a dish is cooked and its flavour profile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sometimes wonder what my parents would have made of today’s diet, which they would have found mysteriously devoid of meat and two veg. Of course, there are still people (some of my best friends and family members among them) for whom a meal isn’t proper unless it includes some kind of animal-based protein, but, while I am an omnivore, I often go days without eating meat at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wine trade, however, there’s still a tendency for the back labels to suggest meat and fish pairings, or to restrict vegetarian recommendations to veggie lasagnes or stews. The world of vegetarian and vegan cooking is as broad, if not broader, than meat, fish and dairy-based food, but many wine producers still seem to be mentally stuck in the nut-roast rut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/22/what-wines-to-drink-with-a-plant-based-diet"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why grow beans at home? It’s easy, they’re great for your health and good for the planet</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/22/why-grow-beans-at-home-its-easy-theyre-great-for-your-health-and-good-for-the-planet</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fresh, demi-sec or dried, the bean is a nutritional powerhouse. And they’re one of the easiest vegetables to grow – so no need to buy frozen or canned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in a food market in Oaxaca, Mexico – and after eating a particularly memorable plate of black beans with waxy, yellow potatoes at the end of a day’s hiking in the mountains – that Susan Young found herself falling hard for beans. She had seen them growing in fields and sold dried, and witnessed how embedded the bean was in Mexican culture and cuisine. So she bought a few back home to Monmouthshire – and before she knew it, a few beans turned into an obsession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young grows beans in her garden specifically to shell and eat either fresh, as demi-sec (semi-dried, with a unique flavour) or dried. She favours varieties from Europe: cassoulet beans from France, the borlotti of Italy, the mongeta and alubias from Spain, brown beans from the Netherlands, mottled beauties from southern Germany and cherry types from eastern Europe. She is so passionate about the power of the bean to change our diet and help the environment that she has written a book on the subject, guiding us from sowing to harvesting and cooking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/22/why-grow-beans-at-home-its-easy-theyre-great-for-your-health-and-good-for-the-planet"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Five charts that show why our food is not ready for the climate crisis</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/22/climate-food-biodiversity-five-charts</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crops are already seeing losses from heat and drought. Can genetic diversity – a return to foods’ origins – help combat the climate challenges ahead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industrialization of agriculture in the last century boosted production around the world – but that success also made our food systems much more vulnerable to the growing climate crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern agriculture depends on high-yield monocrops from a narrow genetic base that needs lots of fertilisers, chemicals and irrigation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/22/climate-food-biodiversity-five-charts"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Dentists would not treat my toothache – now my health has been wrecked for ever</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/20/dentists-would-not-treat-my-toothache-now-my-health-has-been-wrecked-for-ever</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was fit and healthy when I first felt pain in a molar. After numerous dentists and doctors left it untreated, there were knock-on effects throughout my body. Today I am in constant pain and look almost unrecognisable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019 I was fitter than at any other point in my life – and I had a life I loved. It was my third year at the BBC. Every day at New Broadcasting House, I knew that I was seeing world events from a rare vantage point. I loved being surrounded by all the TV monitors and feeling at the centre of things. It had its trials, like any job, but it never stopped feeling like a privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside my work, I was an open-water swimmer and had just topped 20 years of swims between islands and across lakes and rivers with an outing in the Galápagos. In the past I’d climbed Kilimanjaro, raced across the Hellespont in Turkey and along the Thames. I swam between the Cyclades in Greece every autumn and loved the Aegean with a passion. I relished returning to London. I was the first at plays and the cinema. I loved clothes; I probably bought too many. At weekends I would run along the river, then have long breakfasts with friends. And, in a way that is now not unusual, I was in better shape at 52 than I had been at 32.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/20/dentists-would-not-treat-my-toothache-now-my-health-has-been-wrecked-for-ever"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A new start after 60: ‘I won MasterChef – and finally learned to believe in myself’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/18/a-new-start-after-60-masterchef-believe-in-myself-irini-tzortzoglou-chef-speaker</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life as a retired banker bored Irini Tzortzoglou, so she decided to enter the cooking competition. She trained hard to win and now works as a chef, writer and public speaker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she worked in banking, Irini Tzortzoglou’s idea of cooking was to pick up a ready meal from Marks &amp;amp; Spencer at Waterloo station on her way home, and put it in the oven. But now, since winning the BBC cooking competition MasterChef in 2019 at the age of 60, with menus inspired by her Greek heritage, food has become her life and new career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had not been overly interested in cooking, she says with a laugh, though as a child, food was an important part of her life. Tzortzoglou, 64, was born in Crete, where her grandparents’ house was always open – her grandfather was a priest – and her grandmother would often be cooking for dozens of people. Tzortzoglou would help out: “I loved the smells, I loved the processes.” After her parents moved the family to Athens when she was about eight, she didn’t really cook again, until she got married and moved to London. “I thought: ‘I better be a good housewife and feed my husband.’ I bought recipe books, and started cooking three-course meals every day because I was bored.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/18/a-new-start-after-60-masterchef-believe-in-myself-irini-tzortzoglou-chef-speaker"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I was told they didn’t offer C-sections’ – the dangerous obsession with ‘natural births’</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amid recent maternity scandals, women are speaking out about not being listened to when having a baby – in some cases with terrible consequences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sofia Shafaq, a 33-year-old accountant from Leeds, says she had been in labour for three days in July 2021, when she called her midwife and begged for a caesarean section. She had already been to the hospital three times, and, each time she had been sent home. She says the labour hadn’t progressed and she was only 2cm dilated. “It felt like I was going to die. Like someone had put a knife in me and was twisting it.” The midwife made her feel silly for asking for a casearean section. “She said: ‘That’s not something we offer.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shafaq says that, when she was finally allowed into the labour ward, she hadn’t slept or eaten and was too exhausted to push the baby out. Staff had to use forceps and she tore, and had to have an episiotomy. Now, she has a prolapse, which she believes is due to the forceps. “I am angry,” she says. “There’s a lot of trauma there. I’m always in tears.” She believes that all of this would have been avoidable if staff at the hospital had listened. “I am suffering today, because I did not get what I wanted,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/14/i-was-told-they-didnt-offer-c-sections-the-dangerous-obsession-with-natural-births"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The extreme athlete, self-styled Iceman and now a wellness guru claims his breathing techniques and cold-water immersion can help fight modern ailments. I decided to brave his methods ... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Take a deep breath in,” bellows the Iceman, Wim Hof. “And let it go. Fully in … and letting go. Get into your rhythm, fully in, letting go …”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lying on his sofa, I do what he says: a big breath in, then release, 20 more, nine more, four, here comes the last.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/13/can-i-get-out-now-please-could-wim-hof-help-me-unleash-my-bodys-inner-power"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Clean your teeth before breakfast’: the ultimate guide to brushing your teeth</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/your-healthy-mouth-guide/2022/apr/06/clean-your-teeth-before-breakfast-the-ultimate-guide-to-brushing-your-teeth</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We do it every day, but are we doing it right? Here’s how to make sure your teeth are as clean and healthy as they can be&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you brush your teeth before or after breakfast? For most of us, our teeth cleaning habits haven’t changed since childhood: brushing is such an ingrained habit it can often take quite a while for new research to filter through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even when speaking with health visitors about my own children, there have been a couple of occasions where my wife has kicked me under the table because she can see the vein starting to bulge in my forehead,” says Dr Ben Atkins, president of the Oral Health Foundation. “It’s difficult information to get across. Think about who taught you to brush your teeth. I’m 47, so for me it was a generation born in the 1940s, who have had oral health issues … and then the people who taught them often ended up with no teeth.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/your-healthy-mouth-guide/2022/apr/06/clean-your-teeth-before-breakfast-the-ultimate-guide-to-brushing-your-teeth"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>What causes bad breath? – and 11 other common dental questions answered</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/your-healthy-mouth-guide/2022/apr/06/what-causes-bad-breath-and-11-other-common-dental-questions-answered</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is coffee really that bad for our teeth? Does it matter if we don’t floss? And is it possible to repair enamel? Dental expert and hygienist Elaine Tilling has the answers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the first signs of tooth decay to at-home whitening advice, we asked TePe’s dental hygiene expert Elaine Tilling to answer our most pressing dental dos and don’ts. And by gum, she delivered. Here’s everything you ever wanted to know about oral hygiene, but were too scared of the dentist to ask …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. What’s the best thing I can do for my teeth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A. Simple: brush your teeth regularly using a fluoride toothpaste, clean between your teeth daily with floss or an &lt;a href="https://www.tepe.com/uk/products/interdental-brushes/?utm_source=guardian&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=WhatCausesBadBreath&amp;amp;utm_content=TextLink" rel="nofollow"&gt;interdental brush&lt;/a&gt; to clean those tiny spaces, and eat a balanced diet. That doesn’t mean you have to be healthier than thou – chocolate and sweets are only really bad if you graze between meals, but eating them with your meal is OK. Drinks-wise, the safest beverage is water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/your-healthy-mouth-guide/2022/apr/06/what-causes-bad-breath-and-11-other-common-dental-questions-answered"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Practise gratitude’: start your day off right with these seven tips</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/your-healthy-mouth-guide/2022/apr/06/practise-gratitude-start-your-day-off-right-with-these-seven-tips</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With most of us now commuting less for work, Bethan Kapur explores how we can use the extra time we have in the mornings for some mood-boosting self-care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need a confidence boost now that life has gone back to normal after several lockdowns, here’s a tip: ignore the quest for the “perfect body” and add confidence-building habits to your morning routine. According to Alex James, a cognitive behavioural hypnotherapist, spending that time wisely is important. “Get up and do something positive for yourself,” he says. “It’s about setting the intention to have a calm day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Practise gratitude as soon as you wake up&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Life coach Juachi Ezenwa likes to think positive thoughts before she gets out of bed. “I mentally prepare myself in bed because the day you have is determined by your mental strength.” She recommends doing a gratitude exercise as soon as you wake up in the morning. “I think of something I’m looking forward to that day,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/your-healthy-mouth-guide/2022/apr/06/practise-gratitude-start-your-day-off-right-with-these-seven-tips"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>From ‘sound baths’ to rehydrating: 10 ways to boost your energy in the morning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The average daily commute took 59 minutes in 2018. With the hybrid work model now the norm for many people, we take a look at the best wellness practices to help us make the most of the extra time we have&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study by TUC, the average &lt;a href="https://www.tuc.org.uk/news/annual-commuting-time-21-hours-compared-decade-ago-finds-tuc" rel="nofollow"&gt;commute to work took 59 minutes &lt;/a&gt;in 2018 – then the Covid-19 pandemic hit us like a meteor and journeying to day jobs ground to a halt for almost &lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/coronavirusandhomeworkingintheuk/april2020" rel="nofollow"&gt;half of us&lt;/a&gt;. With many of us now working from home for part of our week after the introduction of hybrid working, how can we best spend the extra time we get?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our morning routine sets the tone for the rest of the day, so spending the time we would normally be travelling to work on self-care – rather than sleeping in and then reaching for a strong coffee – means we’ll have more energy and continue to reap the benefits right up until bedtime,” says holistic wellness and mindset expert &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/nourishbynaomi/?hl=en" rel="nofollow"&gt;Naomi Buff&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps it’s time to reset the alarm and spend those 59 minutes boosting your body …&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/your-healthy-mouth-guide/2022/apr/06/from-sound-baths-to-rehydrating-10-ways-to-boost-your-energy-in-the-morning"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How we met: ‘I couldn’t even hug him, we had to be so careful’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/18/how-we-met-i-couldnt-even-hug-him-we-had-to-be-so-careful</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Molly, 20, and Duncan, 21, met online in 2020 while he was shielding during the pandemic. Since then he has been treated for a cancer recurrence but is now in remission and the couple are excited to start their lives together&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the UK went into lockdown in March 2020, Duncan knew he had to protect himself. Two weeks before the rest of the country was asked to stay at home, he received a call from his team of nurses recommending that he shield. “I’d completed treatment for lymphoma a year earlier and it left me with a compromised immune system,” he says. “I was living with my parents in Cumbria, so we stayed in together.” By October, he had started a university course online and was venturing out for long walks in his spare time, but still being cautious. “I love bird-watching. I took lots of pictures and sometimes sent them to friends,” he says. One of his friends was sharing a student flat in Lancaster with a girl named Molly. “She suggested I send the pictures to Molly as she might like them. I jokingly asked if she was single and discovered she was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around a week later, Duncan and Molly connected on Instagram. “I’d been told about him by my flatmate. I think she was secretly trying to set us up,” says Molly. They bonded over a shared love of David Attenborough documentaries and nature. A week later, they set up a short phone call and instantly hit it off. “I found him really interesting and easy to talk to,” she says. Meeting up was difficult as they lived so far apart, and there was no Covid testing available at the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/18/how-we-met-i-couldnt-even-hug-him-we-had-to-be-so-careful"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I’m fit and intelligent but can’t get a date. Should I give up? | Ask Philippa Perry</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/17/ask-philippa-perry-i-am-fit-and-intelligent-but-cant-get-a-date-should-i-give-up</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After trying so long, your wariness is understandable, says Philippa Perry. But remember you’re not shopping – you’re looking for a person to relate to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The question &lt;/strong&gt;I’ve had some short relationships, been on many dates, and had one long-term relationship (a while ago now) where I was dumped &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;on the day before we planned to get married. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;I put a lot of effort into online dating, but the final straw was sending quality personal messages to 47 different women over &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;six month&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;s and receiving nil positive replies. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m in my late 50s, slim, fit, tall, of average and conventional appearance, articulate, humorous and intelligent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From hard work and living modestly, I have been able to retire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; and now volunteer for a charity – the task is mainly helping the sick and disabled. I also co-run a local social group for get-togethers and outings to help not only me, but others, to meet people. I discount those who are too old&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, those who I wouldn’t go on a see-saw with&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and women who say, “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Done that and got the T-shirt” about relationships&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; – and there’s rarely anyone left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/17/ask-philippa-perry-i-am-fit-and-intelligent-but-cant-get-a-date-should-i-give-up"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I quite enjoy sex with women but often find myself thinking about men I see – am I gay, straight or bi?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/19/im-a-22-year-old-man-and-dont-know-if-im-gay-straight-or-bi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t find myself particularly aroused during sex with women, but gay porn doesn’t turn me on. I’m confused&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am a 22-year-old male and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m very confused about my sexuality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I don’t know if I’m gay, straight or bi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I have had sex with women and I enjoy it, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; but generally I don’t find myself massively aroused&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am concerned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; I &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;might be gay, though: I sometimes find I’m thinking about men, and looking at them when I’m out and about&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. That said, I have watched gay porn and it doesn’t turn me on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Nor does lesbian porn – only straight porn works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Please help me &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; – this has been an ongoing problem since I was 16 and I am finding each day a struggle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; just want to know what I am!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are at a very early stage of sexual self-discovery. Most people go through a period of anxiety over the questions “Who am I sexually?” and “Am I normal?” In fact, these questions can only elicit artificial answers, since fully knowing oneself can be a very long process involving a great deal of experimentation. And when it comes to sex, “normality” is not really a useful construct. Instead, of obsessing about ‘Who am I’, ask yourself why you feel the need to label yourself at all. Try to inoculate yourself from the ubiquitous societal tendency to pigeonhole – and focus instead on responding to your true desire for a person of any gender when it arises. Allow yourself to seek genuine human connection and pure pleasure without self judgment or fear of being judged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to &lt;a href="mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com"&gt;private.lives@theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt; (please don’t send attachments).

      <title>A great walk to a great pub: The Star, Bath</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/22/a-great-cotswold-walk-to-a-great-pub-the-star-bath-somerset</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This beautiful stretch of the Cotswold Way serves up hillside views over Bath, and a pub little changed since the 18th century&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many pubs have adapted and modernised to stay afloat, Bath’s old &lt;a href="https://www.star-inn-bath.co.uk/" title=""&gt;Star Inn&lt;/a&gt; stays gloriously unchanged. There’s no food here except crisps and baps, no contemporary decor or fancy wine list; just local beers and jugs of draught Bass from barrels behind the bar, served in a series of little wood-panelled rooms and snugs where a fire burns in winter. The pub is built into one of Bath’s characteristic Georgian terraces, less than half a mile from the city centre’s sights, but just far enough to avoid crowds of visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smooth limestone facade, hung with flowering baskets and carriage lamps, is the glowing goal at the end of a spectacular afternoon’s walk along the &lt;a href="https://www.cotswoldsaonb.org.uk/visiting-and-exploring/walking/cotswold-way-national-trail/" title=""&gt;Cotswold Way&lt;/a&gt;. This acorn-waymarked National Trail runs for 102 miles between Bath and Chipping Campden, through wooded wolds and caramel-stone villages. My plan is to get a bus up into the hills and walk the last few miles of the Cotswold Way back down into the city.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/22/a-great-cotswold-walk-to-a-great-pub-the-star-bath-somerset"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>10 travel firms turning green: new initiatives to boost sustainability</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/21/10-travel-firms-green-new-initiatives-to-boost-sustainability-eco-travel</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of Earth Day on Friday, we pick operators taking action to help the planet and limit overtourism, with eco stays, fewer flights and support for local people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a move designed to help counter overtourism, accommodation provider &lt;a href="http://www.sawdays.co.uk"&gt;Sawday’s&lt;/a&gt; has announced that it will cap the number of places to stay it represents in some of the worst-affected areas. The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/14/us-small-business-certified-b-corporation"&gt;B Corp-certified&lt;/a&gt; company, which includes the brands Sawday’s, Canopy &amp;amp; Stars and Paws &amp;amp; Stay, has identified 13 destinations in the UK and Europe experiencing overtourism. The initiative will effectively limit the company’s own capacity for growth in these at-risk areas, which include the Isle of Skye, Snowdonia, St Ives and the Lake District in the UK, and European hotspots such as Venice and Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/21/10-travel-firms-green-new-initiatives-to-boost-sustainability-eco-travel"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>10 great places to see bluebells in the UK this spring – chosen by readers</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/21/readers-favourite-bluebell-woods-tips-travel-uk</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As bluebells reach their peak across the UK, our tipsters tell us their favourite spots, ‘secret’ or otherwise, for viewing the astonishing woodland spring transformation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favourite place to take in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/17/10-best-places-in-britain-to-see-bluebells-in-bloom"&gt;bluebells&lt;/a&gt;’ beauty and scent is &lt;a href="http://www.newforestexplorersguide.co.uk/days-out/a-little-farther-away/breamore.html"&gt;Breamore Woods&lt;/a&gt; in Hampshire. The public footpath takes you through the main gates of Tudor &lt;a href="https://breamorehouse.com/"&gt;Breamore House&lt;/a&gt;, past the house, stables and clock tower, then uphill through woodland carpeted with bluebells on both sides. As an added bonus, when you emerge from the trees after a mile or so, the view opens out over buttery yellow rape fields and distant farmland. At the very top of the hill is the strange, ancient turf &lt;a href="https://www.visitsoutheastengland.com/things-to-do/breamore-miz-maze-p54983"&gt;Breamore Mizmaze&lt;/a&gt;. I take a turn round that, then it’s all downhill, back through the bluebells and perhaps a cup of tea at the cafe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jane Coundley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/21/readers-favourite-bluebell-woods-tips-travel-uk"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Aquatic bliss: 10 of Europe’s best holiday sites with natural pools</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/20/bed-and-breakfast-villas-apartments-natural-swimming-pools-europe</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From a treehouse camp in France to an organic farm in Ibiza, the author of new guide The Green Traveller picks 10 places to stay with eco swimming pools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing like lounging around a pool on holiday – especially if it’s one of a growing number of eco-friendly “natural pools”. While designs vary, the basic premise is that beyond the swimming area there’s a “regeneration zone”, where aquatic plants and sand act as a natural filter for oxygenising and cleaning the water, also providing a habitat for wildlife and insects – expect to see dragonflies and butterflies flitter across the water. With no chemicals or electricity for driving large pumps they’re good for wildlife – and your skin too. Here are some not to miss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/20/bed-and-breakfast-villas-apartments-natural-swimming-pools-europe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Authorities hope charge for day-trippers will help control numbers after visitors hit pre-pandemic levels &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities in Venice are pushing ahead with a plan to charge day-trippers up to €10 (£8.30) to enter the lagoon city as they scramble to gain control of tourism after visitor numbers hit pre-pandemic levels over the Easter weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The booking system will begin in June with a six-month pilot before potentially taking full effect in January next year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/venice-day-trippers-to-be-charged-up-to-10-to-enter-city"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Beyond the Biennale: Venice’s ‘secret’ Sant’Elena island</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/19/beyond-the-biennale-venice-secret-santelena-island</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While most of La Serenissima will be heaving with visitors during the art fair, which starts this week, this tiny island at the city’s eastern tip is a world apart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venice welcomes back its prestigious &lt;a href="https://www.labiennale.org/en/art/2022"&gt;Biennale&lt;/a&gt;, the art world’s oldest and biggest gathering, from 23 April, after a three-year absence. From that day, vaporetto no 1 water bus, which chugs up the Grand Canal and past Piazza San Marco, will be packed with art lovers, who will stream off at the Giardini boat stop for the Giardini della Biennale, where 30 international pavilions present the latest cutting-edge creations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one stop further, just before the vaporetto steams off across the lagoon to the Lido, is little-known Sant’Elena, a tiny island, separated just by a canal from the rest of the Castello district. Overlooked by most people, it’s an oasis of peace at a time when weekend city centre visitor numbers to the are topping 130,000, significantly more than before the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/19/beyond-the-biennale-venice-secret-santelena-island"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nest told my terminally ill husband that his pension was lost</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/21/nest-told-my-terminally-ill-husband-that-his-pension-was-lost</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;He was trying to get his affairs in order to care for me and there was no empathy or help&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When my husband was diagnosed with a terminal illness, we decided to consolidate our various pensions so I would only have one provider to deal with after his death. Since December, he’s been trying to transfer a pension pot from Phoenix Life to Nest. Nest confirmed it had contacted Phoenix, but that, frighteningly, Phoenix had no record of his policy. He resent the information to Nest, but it again said Phoenix had no record. Phoenix in turn denies receiving any requests and requires us to prove they had been made. My husband’s aggressive cancer has given him little time to get his affairs in order, and this is his final act to try and care for me. But there’s been not a shred of empathy nor inclination to help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JB, Nottingham&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I could intervene, your husband’s policies were finally identified and the transfer completed. Both companies continued to blame each other for the three-month ordeal, and you still wanted answers as to why you had been caused such needless anguish. Thus began another month-long saga. Nest insisted it provided Phoenix with the necessary information in December and January. Phoenix claimed both contained incorrect information, so were rejected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/21/nest-told-my-terminally-ill-husband-that-his-pension-was-lost"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Skoda’s refusal to honour warranty staggers legal experts</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/20/skodas-refusal-to-honour-warranty-staggers-legal-experts</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dealers quoted a policy that was ‘unfair and not legally enforceable’ over critical safety repair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two warning lights appeared on our Skoda Fabia, eight days before the warranty expired. The Skoda handbook recommends driving immediately to the nearest dealer if these lights illuminate, as the car can suddenly lose power. However, neither of our two local Skoda dealers could offer a booking until after the warranty expired, both saying we would have to pay for the repair. Neither would formally log the fault as having arisen during the warranty period. They are adamant this is Skoda policy, which implies any warranty claim can be rejected by not dealing with it until after the expiry date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FK, Dunbar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skoda’s stance is, in my opinion, a breathtaking rebuttal of consumer rights, and I wonder if other brands are similarly trying it on. The email you received when you complained to Skoda UK customer service echoed the dealers’ stance and recommended you find another dealer (the next nearest is 55 miles away) which could fit you in. It helpfully attached the warranty terms and conditions. Nowhere does it state faults must be inspected before the warranty expires, only that they are reported as soon as they occur.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/20/skodas-refusal-to-honour-warranty-staggers-legal-experts"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why didn’t Jet2 warn us our holiday was about to expire?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/19/why-didnt-jet2-warn-us-our-holiday-was-about-to-expire</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a result of Covid cancellations we had a voucher but when I came to use it I was told it had run out only 16 days before&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We booked a holiday tour to Tenerife from Edinburgh with Jet2 in early 2021, which because of Covid was switched to September 2021. However, that trip too was cancelled (by us) and at the time we accepted a voucher to the value of £1,654 – the cost of the original trip, minus the £200 upgrade cost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last week I tried to use the voucher to book a new trip, only to be told it had expired. It turns out that it had an expiry date of just six months. This seems very harsh to me. It had only expired 16 days before I tried to use it – but the company is refusing to budge. We received no warning that it was due to expire. Is this fair?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/19/why-didnt-jet2-warn-us-our-holiday-was-about-to-expire"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Tesco Mobile refuses to believe I didn’t receive my phone</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/18/tesco-mobile-refuses-to-believe-i-didnt-receive-my-phone</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An ex-detective and Bank of England employee cannot seem to convince the firm his phone failed to be delivered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In February I went to the Tesco Mobile outlet in my nearest Tesco store and ordered an upgraded handset – an iPhone. It was for my grandson, who took over my late wife’s Tesco Mobile number.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I paid an extra £29.40, completed the necessary paperwork and was informed that the phone would be delivered to me by DPD. Three days later I personally took delivery of the box, but when I opened it up, instead of the phone, there was a power bank (a portable charger) and a Tesco sim card.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/18/tesco-mobile-refuses-to-believe-i-didnt-receive-my-phone"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Having never owned a property, should we buy or rent a house in Oxford?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/18/having-never-owned-a-property-should-we-buy-or-rent-a-house-in-oxford</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nature of academic job market means staying in city beyond next three years is unlikely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;We are two academics – with one child – moving to Oxford after the summer. My partner has a permanent contract in Europe and I will have a full-time position in Oxford for the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the nature of the academic job market, we have not yet bought a property because we don’t know where I might end up having a permanent position.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/18/having-never-owned-a-property-should-we-buy-or-rent-a-house-in-oxford"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I’ve been trying for months to get Scottish Power to disconnect my gas</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I replaced my gas boiler with an electric one, but am still having to pay standing charges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I replaced my gas boiler and hob with an electric one and have been trying, for three months, to get Scottish Power to disconnect the gas supply. In the meantime, I’m having to pay standing charges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AF, Bristol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your email trail with Scottish Power records staggering incompetence. First, you were wrongly told that you had to call the National Grid to get your meter capped before booking a removal appointment. The National Grid referred you to network provider GTC, which confirmed that removal did not require capping and that Scottish Power could do it, or appoint GTC to oblige for a fee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/14/ive-been-trying-for-months-to-get-scottish-power-to-disconnect-my-gas"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Home Office has kept my passport for eight months</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/13/the-home-office-has-kept-my-passport-for-eight-months</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I applied for a spouse visa, now my life is in limbo until I get it back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am Dutch and, after marrying my British wife, I applied for a spouse visa. My passport was required, and I was advised it would be returned within eight weeks. Eight months later, I still do not have it. I twice escalated the issue with the Home Office and was promised a response within 15 working days, but heard nothing. Eventually, I was advised to make a formal complaint and was told, weeks later, it had not been upheld as there was no standard timescale for visa applications. I involved my MP, who got no further. This has caused many problems as I have to produce it as ID to receive my Dutch pension and I have been unable to visit my family. Apparently I can request my passport back for an emergency but that would cancel my application and I would lose the £1,033 fee paid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JV, Rhydymwyn, Flintshire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My inbox echoes with the pain of visa applicants who’ve endured months of limbo. When I contacted the Home Office, it took a couple of days to discover a problem that your months of calls and emails failed to expose. It claims you wrongly ticked a couple of boxes on the application form, which resulted in you being classed as a refugee. Refugee applications, which take about six months to process, do not incur a fee, and the Netherlands is not noted for its human rights abuses. It is therefore alarming that no one twigged at the outset that you had been put on the wrong track, or at least questioned you further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/13/the-home-office-has-kept-my-passport-for-eight-months"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Wedgwood: a potted history of a missing online order</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/12/wedgwood-a-potted-history-of-a-missing-online-order</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A reader paid at the beginning of December but missed Christmas – and is still waiting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This sounds somewhat trivial compared with everything else that’s going on in the world, but I’m very frustrated with Wedgwood.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On 2 December I ordered a number of things from the pottery firm’s website. While the other items arrived, a £51 plant pot did not, and all my attempts to get it since have failed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/12/wedgwood-a-potted-history-of-a-missing-online-order"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘The anxiety and distrust will never go away’: how financial infidelity can hurt more than an affair</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/11/financial-infidelity-can-hurt-more-than-affair-anxiety-distrust</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether you lie about how much you owe, how much you earn, how much you spend or what you spend it on, sooner or later your partner will likely find out. And it won’t be pretty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kirsten was in her early 20s, she and her then boyfriend, later husband, were saving to buy a house. They had been together four years, and had enough that they were ready to see a mortgage adviser. But, she remembers: “He was avoiding me even going to the appointment, saying: ‘I can go on our behalf – it doesn’t need two of us.’” He had a good job, he was earning a decent salary, he had a nice car, they went on holidays. The first she knew of his £20,000 personal debt was when the mortgage adviser said: “There’s no point even applying for this: you’re not going to get it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A survey in January by &lt;a href="https://money.usnews.com/credit-cards/articles/survey-30-have-either-committed-financial-infidelity-or-been-a-victim"&gt;US News &amp;amp; Report&lt;/a&gt; sketched out how widespread so-called “financial infidelity” is. Some 30% of couples questioned by researchers described lies they had experienced or told in their relationship, the main one being secret purchases (31%), followed by hidden debts (28%) and dishonesty about income (23%). This is by no means a post-pandemic phenomenon, nor is it peculiar to the US.
