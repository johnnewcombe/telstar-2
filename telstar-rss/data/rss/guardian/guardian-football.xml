      <title>Football in Ukraine: ‘Where will the kids train now?’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/football-in-ukraine-where-will-the-kids-train-now</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chernihiv has been destroyed by Russian forces, including the football stadium, but the local population is refusing to give up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chernihiv is the largest Ukrainian city to have been freed from Russian occupation. Its pre-war population was estimated at around 280,000. After being under siege for more than a month only a third of that figure remains. Seven hundred people have lost their lives, according to official sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the Russian invasion on 24 February, the city was little known around the world. It is situated 150 kilometres northeast of Kyiv and just 60km away from the border with Belarus, on the banks of the Desna river. In Ukraine, Chernihiv was known for its wonderful churches, chic parks and great promenades by the river.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/football-in-ukraine-where-will-the-kids-train-now"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>World record crowd sees Barça brush aside Wolfsburg in WCL at Camp Nou</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/world-record-crowd-watches-barcelona-brush-aside-wolfsburg-at-camp-nou</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Camp Nou broke its own attendance world record for a women’s football match on Friday when 91,648 fans revelled in Barcelona’s 5-1 rout of Wolfsburg in the first leg of their Women’s Champions League semi-final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crowd surpassed &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/30/barcelona-real-madrid-womens-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report"&gt;the 91,553 who turned out&lt;/a&gt; to see Barcelona beat Real Madrid last month. Previously, the record for a women’s game was 90,185 for the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jul/11/newsstory.sport7"&gt;1999 Women’s World Cup final&lt;/a&gt; between the United States and China at the Rose Bowl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/world-record-crowd-watches-barcelona-brush-aside-wolfsburg-at-camp-nou"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Helplessness, frustration and fear: the picture of modern Manchester United | David Hytner</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/22/manchester-united-helplessness-frustration-fear-erik-ten-hag-worst-team-late-1980s</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Erik ten Hag will inherit the worst Old Trafford team since the late 1980s and has it all to prove in a comprehensive rebuild &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Big place, this,” Sir Alex Ferguson would say as he gazed around Old Trafford in the early days, a sense of awe in those gruff tones. Big job, too. When Ferguson took over from Ron Atkinson as the Manchester United manager in November 1986, the club were fourth from bottom of the old First Division and the culture was all wrong, especially in the playing squad, where there was too much boozing and not enough achieving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will doubtless be a moment when the scale of it all hits Erik ten Hag, who was confirmed on Thursday as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/erik-ten-hag-appointed-manchester-united-manager-ajax" title=""&gt;United’s next permanent manager&lt;/a&gt;; he will begin work over the summer, once he has finished the season at Ajax. Because not since Ferguson has an incoming manager found the club at such a low ebb.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/22/manchester-united-helplessness-frustration-fear-erik-ten-hag-worst-team-late-1980s"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Harry Kane, the evolving outlier, may be among the last great one-club goalscorers | Barney Ronay</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/22/harry-kane-the-evolving-outlier-may-be-among-the-last-great-one-club-goalscorers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the striker stays at Tottenham, his career could be defined by whether he can reel in Alan Shearer’s Premier League record&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Football tactics are complex chains of reasoning. Football tactics have a chaos theory element. Football tactics must always return to certain key tenets of space and movement. Very bright people are employed to stare at this seeking the tiniest margins of influence. But sometimes you do wonder about the obvious things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the great innovation of the past 15 years has been the way teams attack “between the lines”, as embodied by inside-forwards, false 9s and their many shades. We remember the story of Pep Guardiola’s late-night phone call to Lionel Messi back in May 2009, babbling about switching his role to “the Messi zone”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/22/harry-kane-the-evolving-outlier-may-be-among-the-last-great-one-club-goalscorers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Midfielder offered chance to be club’s best-paid player ever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suitors told he is not for sale and is valued at minimum £150m&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declan Rice has turned down a third offer of a new contract from West Ham and is open to a summer transfer. The terms would have made him the best-paid player in the club’s history at about £200,000 a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The midfielder has no intention of extending his stay at this stage but understands the club do not want to sell and he will not allow his commitment or professionalism to drop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/declan-rice-turns-down-third-west-ham-contract-offer-and-open-to-transfer"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Lewis Hamilton’s love of football drove desire to join Broughton Chelsea bid</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/lewis-hamiltons-love-of-football-drove-desire-to-join-broughton-chelsea-bid</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;F1 world champion and Serena Williams in consortium&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;‘I became an Arsenal fan, but ultimately I’m a sporting fan’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis Hamilton has revealed his childhood love of football and a desire to make a positive impact on diversity in the sport as the motivation behind his involvement in a bid for Chelsea. Hamilton and his close friend Serena Williams have joined Martin Broughton’s consortium in what is believed to be a bid of more than £200m, which the seven-time Formula One world champion described as an “opportunity to be part of something great”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamilton confirmed his involvement on Thursday and speaking before this weekend’s Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola he explained what had prompted him potentially to invest in the Chelsea bid, even though he is an Arsenal fan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/lewis-hamiltons-love-of-football-drove-desire-to-join-broughton-chelsea-bid"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;City Football Group agreed €7m deal for Dutch club&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NAC fans objected via chants, banners and social media&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manchester City’s parent company, the City Football Group, has failed in an attempt to add NAC Breda to its global portfolio after a furious backlash from fans of the Dutch club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CFG agreed a deal last month to buy NAC for €7m and make them the 11th club that its controls and the fifth in Europe – after City, Girona (Spain), Troyes (France) and Lommel (Belgium). The group had previously enjoyed a successful partnership with NAC, which featured City players going there on loan and information sharing in several areas, including scouting, and they were invited to take the relationship further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/manchester-city-football-group-plan-to-buy-nac-breda-fails-after-supporter-backlash"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kevin De Bruyne is still key for Manchester City, Aston Villa are in familiar form and Brighton seek home comfort&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While their team was unconvincing and a little bit lucky in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/everton-leicester-premier-league-match-report"&gt;their midweek draw with Leicester&lt;/a&gt; and the win against Manchester United that preceded it, Everton fans will not care too much how their players perform, or how many goals go in, as long as they can keep hoovering up enough points to keep them ahead of Burnley in the table. On Sunday they make the short trip to Anfield and, given the respective recent performances of themselves and their hosts, it is difficult to envisage anything other than an emphatic Liverpool win. But this is a derby, albeit one where form only very occasionally goes out the proverbial window. While it seems impossible to make a case for Everton derailing Liverpool’s title hopes while taking a further step towards safety by snatching even a single point, far stranger things have happened. &lt;strong&gt;BG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liverpool v Everton, Sunday 4.30pm (all times BST)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manchester City v Watford, Saturday 3pm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Valencia’s Carlos Soler: ‘You’re comparing me to Cazorla, Mata and Silva? Nah’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/valencia-carlos-soler-copa-del-rey-cazorla-mata-silva</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Midfielder who had to be bribed with a Game Boy to join a club hopes to win a second Copa del Rey on Saturday for boyhood team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The familiar lament says technology is taking over, a generation choosing gaming ahead of the game. Football, they say, is losing players to the PlayStation. Not always. This time, it’s the opposite: on Saturday night, Valencia face Real Betis in the final of the Copa del Rey and had it not been for the Game Boy, the man wearing 10 running their midfield wouldn’t have been there. The way he tells it, he might not have been a footballer at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning there was a ball. Carlos Soler grew up watching Valencia from close quarters and English football on Canal+. He has been at the club since he was seven, a ballboy before he was a captain, carrying their flag on European nights at Mestalla. Ask him about a game, not just his, and there are details, enthusiastic analysis. He began a football journalism degree until it became too much, even for him. At one point, he says almost without meaning to and years before he has to, that he would like to coach. And yet he wouldn’t play until grandfather Rafael bribed him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/valencia-carlos-soler-copa-del-rey-cazorla-mata-silva"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Lotte Wubben-Moy: the homegrown Arsenal gift who keeps on giving</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/lotte-wubben-moy-arsenal-new-contract-community-projects-football-art-environment</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Defender’s new deal commits her to work with local girls and women on projects involving football, art and the environment &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lotte Wubben-Moy is not a stereotypical English centre-back. “I’ve always been competing, I’ve always been competitive,” the Arsenal player says, sounding so far, so normal. “But, then again, I’ve always had parts of me that enjoy illustration, enjoy art, enjoy things off the pitch that I hold quite dear to my heart. Things that make me me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Football is everything and nothing to Wubben-Moy, so much a part of who she is but not the only part of her. “It’s something that has been really close to my heart throughout my whole life,” she says. “I went to sixth form in Stoke Newington and almost every single person in that school was an Arsenal supporter. Arsenal in the Community was active at that school. I remember cutting the ribbon for the pitch that was opened there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/lotte-wubben-moy-arsenal-new-contract-community-projects-football-art-environment"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Erik ten Hag is the best coach I have played under – these are the reasons why | Willem Janssen</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/erik-ten-hag-willem-jansen-utrecht-manchester-united</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Utrecht he transformed me and had the skill to make his vision a reality, even if his method was annoying at the start&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erik ten Hag changes your club, your team, yourself. Your vision on football, on cooperation, on the importance of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;new methods, of professionalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You even get a new idea of ​​your own qualities. I was an attacking midfielder for a long time but under him I became a centre-back. I was already 28. I became captain and gained so much more insight into the game – a whole new world opened up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/erik-ten-hag-willem-jansen-utrecht-manchester-united"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Scran? No scran? The new food culture at football grounds</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/when-saturday-comes-blog/2022/apr/22/football-grounds-scran-street-food</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was a time when the food at football stadiums was so bad even seagulls turned up their noses at it. Not any more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/petebrooksbank"&gt;Pete Brooksbank&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.wsc.co.uk/"&gt;When Saturday Comes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a time not too long ago when anyone hoping for a warm meal on the terraces of a lower-league football match would face a stark choice: Pot Noodle, or hunger. While many understandably chose the latter, you would still see innumerable tubs of freeze-dried slop perched precariously on crush barriers, one wayward shot away from discharging their rehydrated gruel over unlucky bystanders. They were often served from little wooden sheds for an astronomical mark-up by faintly furious volunteers who would give you nothing more than an indignant frown if you dared asked for chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things have come a long way since then. Technology has shrunk the size – and price – of once-exotic catering equipment and British culinary tastes were forever broadened by the explosion of affordable casual dining on the high street in the 1990s. A whole new generation of amateur and not-so-amateur chefs have forged a truly global street food scene. From farmers’ markets to music festivals, the choice now offered is bewildering. But there’s always been a market the scene has struggled to break into: football.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/when-saturday-comes-blog/2022/apr/22/football-grounds-scran-street-food"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Burnley boost survival hopes as Connor Roberts sparks sinking of Southampton</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/burnley-southampton-premier-league-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Burnley started life at Turf Moor without Sean Dyche by selecting a classic 4-4-2 formation made up of players their former manager brought to the club, but this was a different team from the one &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/10/norwich-burnley-premier-league-match-report" title=""&gt;that lost 2-0&lt;/a&gt; at Norwich less than two weeks ago. Southampton could not cope with the liberated hosts, who gave themselves hope once again of beating the drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goals from Connor Roberts and Nathan Collins put a revitalised Burnley in control of their first home contest without Dyche at the helm for almost a decade. The victory leaves them one point behind Everton and safety having played a game more, but with a marginally better goal difference. In a carefully poised season, such things could be decisive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/burnley-southampton-premier-league-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago a clash between Arsenal and Manchester United at this stage of the season would have been framed as a title decider. Things have changed plenty since the heady reigns of Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger, however, and Saturday’s early kick-off is reduced to a scuffle to remain in contention for fourth spot. If United – who will be boosted by the return of Cristiano Ronaldo – fail to improve on a dismal run of two wins in seven games their hopes will be virtually over. The picture looks a lot brighter for Arsenal after their victory at Chelsea in midweek and a win for Mikel Arteta’s side would put the pressure firmly back on Tottenham. &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Hollis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt; 12.30pm &lt;em&gt;BT Sport 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/arsenal-manchester-united-match-preview-premier-league"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Brentford v Tottenham: match preview</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/brentford-tottenham-match-preview-premier-league</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The return of Christian Eriksen has been incredibly uplifting and the midfielder will be looking to add another chapter to the fairytale by denting the Champions League hopes of his former club. Eriksen has inspired Brentford to five wins in their past six games to end fears of an instant return to the Championship and Tottenham are unlikely to be given an easy ride as they bid to bounce back from a damaging defeat to Brighton in their last outing. The away fans will give Eriksen a warm reception but hope they will be cheering their own talisman, Harry Kane, come full time, with Brentford being the only one of 31 clubs he has faced in the Premier League that he has yet to score against. &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Hollis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt; 5.30pm &lt;em&gt;Sky Sports Premier League&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/brentford-tottenham-match-preview-premier-league"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Leicester v Aston Villa: match preview</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/leicester-aston-villa-match-preview-premier-league</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leicester will hope to limber up for the visit of José Mourinho’s Roma in the Europa Conference semi-finals on Thursday by returning to winning ways at home against Aston Villa. Leicester have come unstuck in second-half stoppage time in their past two matches but they have lost only one of their past 14 home games and are set to welcome back Jamie Vardy from a knee injury. Vardy has played once since December, after struggling with a hamstring problem earlier in the season. Villa, not yet mathematically safe, equally need to sharpen up after four straight defeats. &lt;strong&gt;Ben Fisher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt; 3pm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/leicester-aston-villa-match-preview-premier-league"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/manchester-city-watford-match-preview-premier-league</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pep Guardiola says he loves this part of the season and for him and his Manchester City team the equation is simple: beat Watford and their remaining five opponents and they will have retained the championship for the second time under his management. Roy Hodgson will want to have a say about this but the problem is City tend to shut most foes up as soon as the first whistle sounds. &lt;strong&gt;Jamie Jackson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt; 3pm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/manchester-city-watford-match-preview-premier-league"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Norwich v Newcastle: match preview</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/norwich-newcastle-match-preview-premier-league</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Newcastle may not be mathematically safe but the bookies have them at 500-1 to go down so their recent purple patch has sealed the deal on another season in the top flight. Eddie Howe will be targeting a top-half finish and what better team to notch up a fourth successive win against than Norwich. Dean Smith’s side showed tremendous fight in defeat against Manchester United last time out but arguably Newcastle will pose a much more difficult proposition. They are a team in sync compared to one carried solely on Cristiano Ronaldo’s shoulders. A Norwich win would close the gap to six points from the last safe spot with five games to play, until Burnley attempt to jump out of danger against Wolves on Sunday. Realistically Norwich’s only hope is to focus on themselves, though, and snatch a win at all costs. &lt;strong&gt;Graham Searles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday&lt;/strong&gt; 3pm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/norwich-newcastle-match-preview-premier-league"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Erik ten Hag faces tough task to turn Manchester United’s ghost ship around | Barney Ronay</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Dutchman will seek to bring warmth and coherence to an ailing celebrity club – it would be hard work for any manager&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Manchester, Erik. We’ve been expecting you. Here it comes at last, the latest rummage, the latest mystery gift from the Manchester United managerial lucky dip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a game you can play with the managerial appointments of the post-Ferguson years. This is an appointment process so refined it has, to date, dished up five random, ill-fitting, hilariously oscillating selections in the course of the past decade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/21/erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-manager-ajax-comment"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Bayern Munich poised for 10th title in a row but how many is too many?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/bayern-munich-bundesliga-10-titles-in-a-row</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Saturday Bayern could reach a mark untouched by any major European club but signs of change are in the air&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even at the moment of Borussia Dortmund’s greatest ecstasy, Hans-Joachim Watzke saw what was coming. It was May 2012 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin and Dortmund were blissfully tearing apart their rivals Bayern Munich 5-2 to seal their first league and cup double.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Lewandowski scored a scintillating hat-trick. Jürgen Klopp got so drunk during the celebrations that he later claimed to have no recollection of them. But their famously pessimistic chief executive was more worried about what might follow. “The echo,” Watzke told his colleagues, “will be dramatic.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/bayern-munich-bundesliga-10-titles-in-a-row"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ronaldo, Maguire, structure: Ten Hag’s key issues at Manchester United</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/21/ronaldo-maguire-ten-hag-key-issues-at-manchester-united</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We look at five significant matters the new manager must tackle, including the areas where signings are most urgent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;big and loaded question: can &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/erik-ten-hag-appointed-manchester-united-manager-ajax" title=""&gt;the manager&lt;/a&gt; actually wield enough influence over the beast that is Manchester United to do it his way? This is a chicken-egg conundrum because winning games and trophies convinces players and the executive but conviction is required from players and the executive for the manager to have his decisions backed and to be a winning No 1. Then there is the club’s particular byzantine brew of politics and peccadilloes. At United Richard Arnold is the chief executive but the real power lies across the Atlantic – the six Glazer siblings who own United and reside in Florida. Joel Glazer may be the day-to-day, hands-on chief of the owners but any major decision has to be signed off by Avram, Darcie, Kevin, Bryan and Edward, who are also directors. This vote-by-committee via a five-hour, stateside time lag is hardly slick and streamlined, particularly when the depth of the owners’ collective football knowledge is unclear. Then there is Erik ten Hag’s main point of contact: John Murtough, the football director, who is a year into his role. Can Murtough be the Txiki Begiristain (Manchester City’s seriously astute sporting director) to the Dutchman’s (hopeful) Pep Guardiola?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/21/ronaldo-maguire-ten-hag-key-issues-at-manchester-united"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Our expectations of football fans seem to be so low – has it always been like this? | Max Rushden</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/expectations-football-fans-seem-so-low-has-it-always-been-like-this-cristiano-ronaldo</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fans were rightly praised for uniting in support of Cristiano Ronaldo, but maybe that’s the least we should expect&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was something moving about the entire crowd at Anfield &lt;a href="https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/teams/manchester-united/12593983/anfield-crowd-pays-tribute-to-ronaldo-with-minutes-applause" title=""&gt;applauding for Cristiano Ronaldo&lt;/a&gt; in the seventh minute on Tuesday night. The “moment of the game,” said Jürgen Klopp. “So many things are much more important in life than football”. He is right of course. It is rare when two sets of supporters – especially rivals – come together for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when you step back and think about it, isn’t it the least we should expect? Being respectful and supportive of someone going through a personal tragedy shouldn’t be a surprising way to act. What does it say about our expectations of football fans and their extreme tribalism that this moment was viewed as a kind of zenith of human behaviour?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/expectations-football-fans-seem-so-low-has-it-always-been-like-this-cristiano-ronaldo"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Alessia Russo: ‘To be a United fan and play at the Theatre of Dreams was amazing’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/alessia-russo-to-be-a-united-fan-and-play-at-the-theatre-of-dreams-was-amazing</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The United forward talks goal celebrations and how she and the team are enjoying the pressure of chasing a Champions League place&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To be honest, I don’t normally celebrate goals,” says Alessia Russo. However after the Manchester United forward sent a looping header over Sandy MacIver to draw her team level against Everton at the end of March, the 23-year-old clenched her fists and yelled in delight as teammate Martha Thomas leapt into her arms. It was an uncharacteristic celebration and in many ways she looked like she didn’t know what to do, but the occasion warranted one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russo, a lifelong United supporter, had scored at Old Trafford in front of 20,241 fans, including her family and friends. She went on to score a second to give United a 3-1 victory that would keep them three points clear of Manchester City and their race for the Champions League alive. City have a game in hand though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/alessia-russo-to-be-a-united-fan-and-play-at-the-theatre-of-dreams-was-amazing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Tuchel struggles to make case for the defence as Chelsea flirt with chaos | Jacob Steinberg</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/21/thomas-tuchel-case-for-the-defence-chelsea-chaos</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chelsea need a rethink – the mess against Arsenal did not come out of the blue and Thomas Tuchel knows it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a measure of how badly Wednesday night went for Chelsea nothing summed it up more than Thomas Tuchel blaming his side’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/chelsea-arsenal-premier-league-match-report"&gt;latest shoddy defensive display&lt;/a&gt; on the state of the Stamford Bridge turf. “It is a very difficult pitch we have here,” Tuchel said as his thoughts turned to Andreas Christensen setting Arsenal on their way to victory by handing Eddie Nketiah the opening goal with a comical shank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is not to our favour and the ball bounces very, very awkwardly when the ball bounces to Andreas.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/21/thomas-tuchel-case-for-the-defence-chelsea-chaos"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Heavy shelling of FC Desna's stadium in Ukraine leaves crater in pitch – video</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2022/apr/22/heavy-shelling-stadium-ukraine-fc-desna-chernihiv-ukraine</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;FC Desna's stadium in Chernihiv, 100 miles north of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, has suffered huge damage due to heavy shelling in the area. A large crater can be seen in the middle of the playing field, while the stands and other facilities are either crumbling or covered in debris.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desna were playing in the Ukrainian Premier League before it was suspended due to the ongoing Russian invasion, and played their first European game in 2020, against Wolfsburg in the Europa League. The stadium, officially named the Chernihiv Olympic Sports Training Centre, was once named after the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2022/apr/22/heavy-shelling-stadium-ukraine-fc-desna-chernihiv-ukraine"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>'I like his football': Ralf Rangnick backs Erik ten Hag to succeed at Manchester United – video</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Manchester United interim manager, Ralf Rangnick, has said he expects to see 'improvement' under the incoming permanent manager, Erik ten Hag. The German reiterated that the club plans to rebuild in the summer after what has been a disappointing season and added that midfielder Paul Pogba, whose contract expires this summer, is 'unlikely' to feature for Manchester United again this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/manchester-united-fan-view-ten-hag-gives-me-hope-unlike-the-glazers"&gt;Manchester United fan view: ‘Ten Hag gives me hope – unlike the Glazers’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2022/apr/22/ralf-rangnick-backs-erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Erik ten Hag has been appointed Manchester United's new manager and expectations are inevitably high. The former Ajax boss faces a challenge as pressure for the team to rebuild and improve rapidly grows. However, he has been highly commended by many in the football world – and is believed to have been very vocal in talks about his criticisms over United's recruitment policy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/erik-ten-hag-appointed-manchester-united-manager-ajax"&gt;Erik ten Hag appointed as new Manchester United manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2022/apr/21/erik-ten-hag-the-challenge-facing-manchester-uniteds-new-manager-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel admitted that he can sympathise with the Chelsea supporter who was involved in a heated exchange with captain César Azpilicueta after the final whistle. This was the first time since 1993 that Chelsea have suffered three straight home defeats in all competitions. Tuchel added that the pitch at Stamford Bridge was partly to blame for their recent poor run of form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/chelsea-thomas-tuchel-empathising-with-fan-cesar-azpilicueta-arsenal"&gt;Chelsea’s Tuchel admits to empathising with fan who confronted Azpilicueta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2022/apr/21/chelseas-thomas-tuchel-understands-the-fan-after-confrontation-with-cesar-azpilicueta-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2022/apr/17/emma-hayes-savours-chelseas-womens-fa-cup-semi-final-victory-arsenal-video</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chelsea have beaten Arsenal in the Women's FA Cup semi-final after second-half goals from Guro Reiten and Ji So-yun in Borehamwood set up a Wembley final appointment with Manchester City. Emma Hayes praised her team but admitted to a slow start that 'didn't follow the gameplan'. Chelsea’s defensive solidity, however, allowed them to absorb the early pressure and improve their performance in the second half to take the victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/17/arsenal-v-chelsea-womens-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report"&gt;Chelsea sink Arsenal to set up Women’s FA Cup final with Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2022/apr/17/emma-hayes-savours-chelseas-womens-fa-cup-semi-final-victory-arsenal-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>'It was an accident': Pep Guardiola defends Zack Steffen after FA Cup blunder – video</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pep Guardiola defended his team selection and goalkeeper Zack Steffen following a dreadful first-half display in their FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool. The US international was one of seven changes Guardiola made from the team that started Wednesday’s bruising Champions League quarter-final at Atlético Madrid. 'It can happen, so it's an accident,' said Guardiola. 'After that he had the courage to play, he made good decisions and good saves and he's an exceptional keeper.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/guardiola-defends-zack-steffen-after-mistake-against-liverpool-costs-city"&gt;Guardiola defends Zack Steffen after mistake against Liverpool costs City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/manchester-city-liverpool-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report"&gt;Liverpool survive Manchester City scare to reach FA Cup final after Mané double&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/manchester-city-apologise-after-fan-chants-mar-minutes-silence-for-hillsborough"&gt;Manchester City apologise after fan chants mar minute’s silence for Hillsborough&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2022/apr/16/it-was-an-accident-pep-guardiola-defends-zack-steffen-after-fa-cup-blunder-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Fifa ethics committee investigating sexual misconduct claims in Canadian soccer</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/fifa-ethics-committee-investigating-sexual-misconduct-claims-in-canadian-soccer</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cases involving two prominent coaches have led to football’s governing body looking into the game in Canada&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifa has confirmed the investigatory chamber of its ethics committee has launched an investigation into the actions of disgraced former Canada youth national team coach Bob Birarda and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/28/abuse-allegations-vancouver-whitecaps-womens-team-hubert-busby-jr-soccer"&gt;allegations of sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt; against former Vancouver Whitecaps women’s team coach Hubert Busby Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifa is publicly downplaying the investigation, saying the investigatory chamber is “gathering information”. However, the Guardian can confirm Martin Ngoga, a Rwandan politician and lawyer who is chair of the chamber, has labeled the inquiries as “investigation proceedings”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/fifa-ethics-committee-investigating-sexual-misconduct-claims-in-canadian-soccer"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>European roundup: Real Madrid move to within four points of title at Osasuna</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Madrid need four points to claim title after 3-1 win over Granada&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Juventus beat Fiorentina and will meet Inter in Coppa Italia final&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real Madrid&lt;/strong&gt; continued their march towards a 35th La Liga title as goals from David Alaba, Marco Asensio and Lucas Vázquez earned them a 3-1 win at &lt;strong&gt;Osasuna&lt;/strong&gt; on Wednesday, with Karim Benzema missing two penalties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victory means Real have 78 points and hold a 17-point lead at the top over their closest rivals &lt;strong&gt;Atlético Madrid&lt;/strong&gt;, who were held to a goalless draw by &lt;strong&gt;Granada&lt;/strong&gt;. Barcelona in third and fourth-placed Sevilla are a point further back and both play on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/osasuna-real-madrid-la-liga-psg-juventus"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>European roundup: Inter power past Milan to reach Coppa Italia final</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/19/european-roundup-inter-milan-coppa-italia-dfb-pokal-la-liga</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Internazionale beat title rivals 3-0 in semi-final second leg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Freiburg see off Hamburg to reach first German Cup final&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lautaro Martínez grabbed a first-half double as Internazionale overcame rivals Milan to make the Coppa Italia final with a 3-0 second-leg and aggregate victory at San Siro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a goalless draw in the first leg, Inter went ahead after just four minutes here when Martínez smartly turned in Matteo Darmian’s cross at the near post. Milan rallied and Inter keeper Samir Handanovic was forced into fine saves to deny Rafael Leão and Alexis Saelemaekers. The &lt;em&gt;Rossoneri&lt;/em&gt; were left to rue those missed chances as Inter doubled their lead five minutes before the interval.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/19/european-roundup-inter-milan-coppa-italia-dfb-pokal-la-liga"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Christophe Galtier led Lille to the title but he has stalled at Nice</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/christophe-galtier-lille-title-nice-ligue-1-psg</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nice were meant to challenge PSG under Galtier, but he is short of ideas and they are falling down the table&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_adam_white_?lang=en"&gt;Adam White&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/"&gt;Get French Football News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s too early to say,” was supposedly Chinese leader Zhou Enlai’s response when asked in 1972 if the French revolution, which had occurred 200 years earlier, had been a success. The story is probably apocryphal, with Zhou most likely referring to the French student protests of the late 1960s, but long-term thinkers would offer a similar response now if asked to analyse Lille’s footballing revolution following their shock title win last season under the previously uninspiring Christophe Galtier. His current club, Nice, were expected to push for the title this season, but they have dropped out of Ligue 1’s European places this week, suggesting his revolution may be short lived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galter’s newfound managerial aura benefits from strong recency bias. After a decade as an assistant at clubs including Portsmouth, Al-Ain, Aris Soloniki and Lyon, he ascended to his first managerial role at struggling St Étienne in December 2009. Galtier kept the club up and kept his job. Over the next eight seasons, St Étienne became regulars in Europe and even &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Coupe_de_la_Ligue_Final"&gt;won the Coupe de la Ligue in 2013&lt;/a&gt; but, with their resources and quality dwindling, they soon plateaued.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/21/christophe-galtier-lille-title-nice-ligue-1-psg"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Roma on the rise as Mourinho’s ‘us against the world’ mentality pays off | Nicky Bandini</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/19/roma-on-the-rise-as-jose-mourinho-us-against-the-world-mentality-pays-off-serie-a</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Draw at Napoli was yet more evidence that the manager’s bond with his players has improved results immeasurably&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the curtain came down on Napoli’s 1-1 draw with Roma, Lorenzo Insigne turned and booted a water bottle back toward his bench. His body language spoke less of rage than resignation. The player’s hopes of leaving his boyhood club with a Serie A title as a parting gift had already dimmed with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/11/napoli-scudetto-hopes-fiorentina-football"&gt;defeat to Fiorentina in the previous round&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this was a day that could have belonged to him. Insigne’s well-taken penalty put Napoli ahead for 80 minutes. A win would at least have kept them in touching distance of the summit. Instead, someone else had taken hold of the narrative. Not Stephan El Shaarawy, who scored the injury-time equaliser – firing past Alex Meret at the end of a scintillating move, in which nine Roma players touched the ball and the last five only once each – but an inevitable José Mourinho.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/19/roma-on-the-rise-as-jose-mourinho-us-against-the-world-mentality-pays-off-serie-a"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/18/philippe-clement-monaco-champions-league</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Belgian had a slow start when he joined the club in January but his players have found form at the right time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericdevin_"&gt;Eric Devin&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/"&gt;Get French Football News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After their inspirational performances in the run-in last season, when the league title was in play until the very end of the campaign, Monaco and Niko Kovac seemed like a match made in heaven. Kovac had shaken off the disappointment of his spell with Bayern Munich and was getting a tune out of Monaco’s young players, such as Youssouf Fofana, Aurélien Tchouaméni and Sofiane Diop, as well as veterans Kevin Volland and Wissam Ben Yedder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their league form was patchy at the start of this season and a cruel elimination in the final qualifying round for the Champions League did Kovac no favours, but his players were learning how to deal with the dual demands of European and domestic football. Despite leading them to top spot in a tough Europa League group, Kovac was dismissed by the club mid-season in a decision that, for many, smacked of impatience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/18/philippe-clement-monaco-champions-league"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>After yet another comeback the Liga title will soon be Real Madrid’s again | Sid Lowe</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/18/after-yet-another-comeback-the-liga-title-will-soon-be-real-madrids-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To follow PSG and Chelsea, Sevilla were the latest team to suffer from Carlo Ancelotti’s men’s powers of recovery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the middle of it all, someone fetched David Alaba a chair. It was late, it had been a long week, his legs were weary and everyone were making a lot of noise, but this seat was not for sitting. This was for celebrating, his thing now, and so he took it and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realmadrid/status/1515802702713868294?s=20&amp;amp;t=0n9iJJLce9newDkAqE1zvg"&gt;lifted it above his head&lt;/a&gt;. Back by popular demand, he emulated what he had done after &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/10/psg-full-force-of-history-loss-real-madrid"&gt;that absurd comeback against Paris Saint-Germain&lt;/a&gt;, a cheer went round the dressing room and his teammates started singing: “That’s the way Madrid win!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They had only gone and done it again, and this time it had taken the title. “It’s just three points, that’s the reality,” Nacho Fernández said standing pitchside when it was all finished bar the shouting, and there was a lot of that, but the reality was that the league was theirs, clinched their way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/18/after-yet-another-comeback-the-liga-title-will-soon-be-real-madrids-again"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;‘We had high hopes… It hasn’t worked,’ says Tony Pignata&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Striker unlikely to be offered new contract at end of season&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perth Glory’s gamble on Daniel Sturridge has been labelled a failure by chief executive Tony Pignata, who admits it is unlikely the English striker will be offered a new deal with the A-League Men club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sturridge, a former Liverpool forward with 26 England caps, was the highest-profile signing heading into the 2021-22 ALM season but has featured for just 93 minutes across five substitute appearances – failing to find the net.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/perth-glory-ceo-admits-daniel-sturridge-move-has-failed"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Euro 2022 stadium choices appeared unambitious in 2018 – they look worse now | Suzanne Wrack</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/euro-2022-stadium-choices-appeared-unambitious-in-2018-they-look-worse-now</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir’s anger at Iceland playing in a 5,000-capacity venue is understandable. The FA has been caught out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week the Iceland midfielder Sara Björk Gunnarsdóttir &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/19/embarrassing-euro-2022-criticised-for-hosting-games-at-city-academy-stadium" title=""&gt;voiced her frustration&lt;/a&gt; over the choice of venues for the women’s European Championship finals in England this summer. She questioned why two of her country’s games would be played at the 5,000-capacity Manchester City Academy Stadium and her remarks highlighted a number of important questions, chiefly among them whether the Football Association was ambitious enough in its choice of venues and whether it has done enough to adapt to the accelerating growth of the game? Arguably, the answer to both questions is no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There can be some sympathy for the position the FA has found itself in four years since crafting the bid to host the tournament. In August 2018, when the FA revealed its plans, and in December of that year when the solo bid was revealed to have been successful, women’s football was in a very different place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/euro-2022-stadium-choices-appeared-unambitious-in-2018-they-look-worse-now"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Fulham cruise to promotion but must sharpen up for Premier League survival | Ben Fisher</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/fulham-promotion-premier-league-survival-marco-silva</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Marco Silva’s entertainers have dominated the Championship but thoughts will quickly turn to ending yo-yo status&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there we have it. An unnervingly satisfying and problem-free season for Fulham has culminated exactly how near enough everyone thought it would, with warm congratulatory messages and celebrations after &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/19/fulham-preston-championship-match-report" title=""&gt;a leisurely return to the Premier League&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end it was not quite the serene stroll over the finishing line most envisaged but they were rarely troubled, always well-stocked – they have failed to find the net in only four Championship matches this season – and with the procession complete and promotion boxed off, the question is whether Fulham will round things off by chalking up a century of goals (they have 98) in the remaining four games, winning the title and, more pertinently, can they shed their reputation as a yo-yo team on their return to the top table? The reality is Marco Silva’s attention will soon turn, if it has not already, towards becoming at least the 17th best team in England.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/fulham-promotion-premier-league-survival-marco-silva"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Sean Dyche gave us the gift of Peak Burnley – for that, we owe him thanks | Jonathan Liew</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/19/sean-dyche-burnley-manager-premier-league</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wrongly typecast as a proponent of anti-football, Dyche gave the people of Burnley a team they could be proud of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Sean Dyche the road to salvation would begin at Rock City in Nottingham. Liberated from the treadmill of management for the first time in almost a decade &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/burnley-sack-sean-dyche-in-midst-of-premier-league-relegation-battle" title=""&gt;after being sacked by Burnley&lt;/a&gt;, Dyche enjoyed his first weekend of freedom having drinks with friends before taking in a bill of Manchester tribute acts. Camera‑phone footage from Sunday night shows him swaying along to a band called The Clone Roses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which on reflection feels about perfect. Given everything else going on at the moment, we may not have been ready as a society for the idea of a sad Sean Dyche. Dyche’s year-long New York sabbatical. Dyche’s lonely, penitent pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. A tearful Dyche addressing his adoring public one last time from the steps of Burnley town hall, as mourners lay scarves and candles at his feet. Nobody wants any of this. Dyche grooving along to (Song For My) Sugar Spun Sister on a shaky camera phone: nature has healed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/19/sean-dyche-burnley-manager-premier-league"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Fiver | Liverpool’s tilt at what could actually be a quintuple</title>

Sign up now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is customary to solemnly declare that “form goes out the window” in football derbies, but as the players of Frank Lampard’s Everton gird their loins before Sunday’s trip across Stanley Park to Anfield, The Fiver isn’t so sure this will be the case. Sure, when push comes to shove, it’s 11 highly gifted footballers against 11 and anything could happen, but in terms of form, we’re struggling to envisage a scenario in which Sadio Mané and Luis Díaz repeatedly trip over their own feet while behind them Alisson keeps shanking clearances over the roof of the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/the-fiver-frank-lampards-everton-liverpool"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Moving the Goalposts | PSG’s Sara Däbritz on finding strength in adversity and her love for the game</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/psgs-sara-dabritz-on-finding-strength-in-adversity-and-her-love-for-the-game</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week’s newsletter: we speak to the Germany midfielder about recovering from an ACL injury and playing in front of 20,000 fans at Parc des Princes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Moving the Goalposts, the Guardian’s new (and free) women’s football newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version once a week, just pop your email in below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sara Däbritz breaks into a laugh mid-sentence. We are discussing what advice she would give a young player hoping to become a footballer when she suddenly stops and says: “Hmm, what’s the word I am looking for? Sometimes I have the German word in my head and then I start speaking in English before realising that I don’t know it, so I have to start again!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/psgs-sara-dabritz-on-finding-strength-in-adversity-and-her-love-for-the-game"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Knowledge | Has any club ever played every game in every competition in a season?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/has-any-club-ever-played-every-game-in-every-competition-in-a-season-knowledge</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Plus: the origins of shithousery; players named after politicians (2); and attacking an opponent with the corner flag&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“If Liverpool make it to the final of the Champions League they will end up playing every game in every competition they entered this season,”&lt;/strong&gt; explains Niall Carey. &lt;strong&gt;“Has any other team managed this feat before?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has happened more often than we realised. Let’s start with a heartbreaking example from the north-east. “In the 1996-97 season, Middlesbrough reached (and lost) the final of both the League Cup (after a replay) and the FA Cup and were relegated from the Premier League,” writes Paul Brack, a single tear rolling solemnly down his cheek. “They hadn’t qualified for Europe, so they played every game in every competition they entered.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/20/has-any-club-ever-played-every-game-in-every-competition-in-a-season-knowledge"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Premier League and FA Cup: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/18/premier-league-and-fa-cup-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Liverpool are getting recruitment right, Newcastle have a new hero in Bruno Guimarães and Christian Eriksen can get better&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2020, Liverpool were big favourites to sign Timo Werner from RB Leipzig before the move fell through when Jürgen Klopp could not assure his fellow German of regular first-team football. Liverpool fans have spent the last couple of seasons relieved that the striker chose Chelsea instead, his numbers way down on what they were in the Bundesliga. Werner remains a maddening but intriguing presence. Watch the denouement of the FA Cup semi-final. In the final 10 minutes, he overruns the ball to ruin a fast break, has the energy to get back and halt a Palace counterattack, is named man of the match, flashes a cross into the box with no Chelsea shirt in sight, drives into the area again to put the ball on a plate for Romelu Lukaku, who hits a post, and rounds it all off by ballooning a dreadful shot into Row Z. There is Werner’s Chelsea career in microcosm. Wild, erratic and inconsistent and yet he’s capable of being the biggest threat to Klopp and Liverpool in next month’s FA Cup final. &lt;strong&gt;David Tindall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Match report: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/17/chelsea-crystal-palace-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report"&gt;Chelsea 2-0 Crystal Palace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Match report: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/manchester-city-liverpool-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report"&gt;Manchester City 2-3 Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Match report: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/manchester-united-norwich-premier-league-match-report"&gt;Manchester United 3-2 Norwich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Match report: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/tottenham-brighton-premier-league-match-report"&gt;Tottenham 0-1 Brighton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Match report: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/16/southampton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report"&gt;Southampton 1-0 Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/18/premier-league-and-fa-cup-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Women’s Super League: talking points from the weekend’s action</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/04/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-weekends-action</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vivianne Miedema eyes the prize, Chelsea’s defence impress as much as their potent attack, plus a Mancunian scrap for third &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who knows where Vivianne Miedema will play next season but for now she is Arsenal’s, and so important to Jonas Eidevall’s team. The Dutch striker has revealed that several clubs are interested in signing her for next season – she is out of contract in the summer – but there are no signs that her mind is elsewhere. When Arsenal thrashed Leicester City 5-0 on Sunday to briefly go top of the WSL the Netherlands international was in sparkling form. Miedema had two close efforts before half-time, one saved by the goalkeeper Demi Lambourne and another smacked against the woodwork. Then came two goals in the space of eight second-half minutes that took Arsenal away from Leicester. Jemma Purfield’s clearance stopped at Miedema’s feet at the edge of the box and she executed a one-touch finish. Her second came after a well-worked assist from Nikita Parris. With the league’s title race going down to the wire, the Gunners will be hoping Miedema’s sparkle isn’t extinguished. &lt;strong&gt;SR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As it happened: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/apr/03/leicester-v-arsenal-womens-super-league-live"&gt;Leicester 0-5 Arsenal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Match report: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/03/chelsea-reading-wsl-match-report"&gt;Chelsea 5-0 Reading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/04/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-weekends-action"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hasty was one of football’s most remarkable and overlooked players – who then fell victim to a malignant arc of history&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1960 Jim Malone, the chairman of Dundalk football club, told the board he had discovered an exciting talent, a centre-forward who was scoring goal after goal for Newry Town, just across the border in Northern Ireland. He was tall and strong, had preternatural balance and was lethal in the air. Dundalk should sign him immediately, said Malone. The player’s name was Jimmy Hasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another board member piped up. He had heard of Hasty, heard something fanciful – that the fellow had only one arm. Malone conceded this was true. Hasty had only one arm. But Dundalk should sign him, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/13/the-forgotten-story-of-jimmy-hasty-irish-football-one-armed-wonder"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Joy of Six: Leeds United v Liverpool Premier League meetings</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/sep/11/the-joy-of-six-leeds-united-v-liverpool-premier-league-meetings</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A look at classics from a Tony Yeboah special in 1995 to a symbolic defeat for David O’Leary in 2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s your favourite: Liverpool or Wimbledon? Tony Yeboah won Goal of the Month in August and September 1995 for two screamers, at Elland Road and Selhurst Park, both scorched off the underside of the bar from distance. The Wimbledon goal, a manic, impromptu explosion of brilliance, has greater charisma and was the BBC’s Goal of the Season. But the goal against Liverpool involved a more difficult skill, volleying a ball that was dropping from the heavens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/sep/11/the-joy-of-six-leeds-united-v-liverpool-premier-league-meetings"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Oleksandr Zinchenko: ‘If you stay silent it means you support what is happening in Ukraine’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/oleksandr-zinchenko-ukraine-russia-manchester-city</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Manchester City player on the atrocities back home and his frustration with former teammates in Russia who do not speak out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukrainians do not have the luxury of shielding themselves from bad news. “I can’t live outside this situation,” Oleksandr Zinchenko says. “Trying to follow everything is basically my life now. The first thing I do every day is reach for my phone, and then it’s in my hand constantly. It’s been more than seven weeks now and you can see some people starting to forget, starting to adapt to the brutality in my country. No, no, no. People are starving, dying, bodies being discovered, so how can anyone relax? You have to talk even more. I hate the people who invaded our land more and more and more every day. I won’t stop talking about it, because the whole world has to know the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is the exhausting but grimly necessary reality for Zinchenko and his compatriots. Every action is cast in the shadow of Russia’s invasion, with its barbaric consequences, and among the biggest concerns is that people outside become desensitised. It simply would not do and, on an Easter weekend when professional commitments bring an FA Cup semi-final for Manchester City against Liverpool, he wants to use his platform. For almost an hour his anger pours out, sometimes in controlled rage but often in raw expressions of hurt. Words can capture people’s attention but, in whatever order, they still cannot rationalise exactly what is happening inside Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/15/oleksandr-zinchenko-ukraine-russia-manchester-city"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Mystical, magical, Madrid: Real make the impossible seem inevitable again | Sid Lowe</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/13/real-madrid-make-impossible-seem-inevitable-again-chelsea</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Ancelotti’s team were down and seemingly out against Chelsea they found another absurd and epic response&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Tuchel had &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/11/chelsea-need-fantastic-script-to-beat-real-madrid-admits-thomas-tuchel" title=""&gt;demanded a “fantastic script”&lt;/a&gt; and boy did he get one, another epic and implausible story unfolding. Just not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as he had hoped; Real Madrid had rewritten the ending, the way they so often seem to do. “The magic of the Bernabéu,” Carlo Ancelotti called it. It would have been barely believable, except that they had seen it somewhere before. The last time they were here, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go back a month. Scribble out &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/10/psg-full-force-of-history-loss-real-madrid" title=""&gt;where it says PSG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/real-madrid-chelsea-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report" title=""&gt;write Chelsea instead&lt;/a&gt;. Just don’t touch the mentions of Madrid, the club who have made the impossible feel inevitable. It doesn’t matter if it’s absurd, how bad things are – how bad &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are – when that final scene comes, there they are: still standing, rubble all round. Just as you imagined, just as they like it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/13/real-madrid-make-impossible-seem-inevitable-again-chelsea"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘A cultural moment’: what Bend It Like Beckham meant for UK women’s football</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/a-cultural-moment-what-bend-it-like-beckham-meant-for-uk-womens-football</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty years later and on verge of hosting Euros, south Asian players celebrate film and what it meant for the sport&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Yasmin Hussain was a child growing up in Manchester in the 1990s, she was football mad. At first she played the sport with boys, but when she turned 13 her parents told her she needed to find a women’s team to continue. The problem was, there wasn’t one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that time, women’s football was a niche sport rarely depicted on screen. When Bend It Like Beckham came out in 2002 – telling the story of Jesminder and her battle to play football against the wishes of her parents – Hussain was left thinking: “She’s lucky, she had a team to join. I didn’t have one.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/12/a-cultural-moment-what-bend-it-like-beckham-meant-for-uk-womens-football"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Gazza: story of a footballer mercilessly used and abused by tabloid press | Barry Glendenning</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/09/gazza-documentary-paul-gascoigne-footballer-tabloid-press</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Documentary chronicles turbulent life from early days as gifted teenage midfielder to admission to the Priory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no great spoiler to reveal that, apart from Gazza’s opening and closing scenes filmed near a Hampshire fishing lake, it is comprised of archive footage. The subject of this two-part documentary, to be shown on the BBC, had been booked to participate in a Q&amp;amp;A after a London press screening on Thursday, but despite being spotted at the venue was a no-show. The appearance of the footballer’s latter-day incarnation proved even more fleeting in “real life” as it was on screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Gascoigne, we were told, did not feel up to facing the press and had adjourned to his hotel. While there is no suggestion his decision to abscond was rooted in any particular mistrust of the fourth estate, this film chronicling his stellar rise and subsequent fall from grace demonstrated that any misgivings he might have had would have been entirely justified. Whether intentional or not, the underlying theme of Gazza is one of venal treachery. It is the story of how one man was mercilessly used and ultimately driven to madness and the brink of suicide by the scurrilous and often illegal machinations of the tabloid press.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/09/gazza-documentary-paul-gascoigne-footballer-tabloid-press"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
