      <title>Bohannon stars for Lancs; Masood dazzles for Derbyshire: county cricket – as it happened</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look back on the day two action from around the grounds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bohannon scores unbeaten 142 for Lancs against Gloucs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part of the advertising hoarding blow&lt;/strong&gt;s onto the pitch and play is held up while some poor sap has to run and gather it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to put this here, just in case Bohannon doesn’t make the milestones when I’m watching. Stats courtesy of Ken Grime. When/if Bohannon reaches 46 this morning, he will have reached 2000 f-c runs. If he makes 119, he will have made 2000 f-c runs for Lancs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/apr/22/lancashire-v-gloucestershire-surrey-v-somerset-and-more-county-cricket-live"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A DRS defence for Boris Johnson? That’s simply not cricket, Jacob Rees-Mogg | Letter</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/22/a-drs-defence-for-boris-johnson-thats-simply-not-cricket-jacob-rees-mogg</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Brexit opportunities minister does not seem to understand the rules of the game, writes &lt;strong&gt;Clive Stafford Smith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we all thought Etonians understood one thing, it would be the finer points of cricket. However, Jacob Rees-Mogg’s analogy to the game during a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight/status/1516459668465463303" title=""&gt;recent on-street interview&lt;/a&gt; with Nick Watt of BBC Two’s Newsnight programme either betrayed that he was no devotee of the game or, perhaps, that he was subtly betraying his esteemed leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that Boris Johnson’s reaction to Partygate could be compared to a batsman, given out by the on-pitch umpire, turning to the DRS (decision review system) – an honest disagreement. But if that were the case and the DRS showed him to be out, the batsman would not be at liberty to announce: “This was all a jolly rotten misunderstanding, but I’ll just continue batting.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/22/a-drs-defence-for-boris-johnson-thats-simply-not-cricket-jacob-rees-mogg"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Gloucs test Anderson at Old Trafford, Somerset find form – as it happened</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/apr/21/lancashire-v-gloucestershire-surrey-v-somerset-county-cricket-live</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;James Anderson could not find a wicket as Gloucestershire started strongly at Old Trafford, while Tom Abell scored a century at the Oval&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Greetings from Edgbaston, [Hello Ali!] &lt;/strong&gt;where it’s typically tropical weather-wise and the Essex boys are in town. We’ve got a very short boundary to the left as I look towards the city and what looks like a good pitch out in the middle - hence the decision by the visitors to have a bat upon winning the toss. So it’s Alastair Cook and Nick Browne starting out against a new-ball pairing of Oliver Hannon-Dalby and Liam Norwell, with the latter having missed the run-fest versus Surrey due to a bad back. A squirted four for Cook during an otherwise probing st.. oh, a wicket ... OHD tempts Browne with a wide one and the edge flies to a diving Michael Burgess behind the stumps. Essex six for one in the fifth over of the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only Glamorgan &lt;/strong&gt;have lost a wicket in the first 15 mins of the day, Salter giving catching practise off Toby Roland-Jones. Stream alert - you can now watch Shaheen Shah Afridi bowling to Marnus Labuschagne: 1980s quality county cricket. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/apr/21/lancashire-v-gloucestershire-surrey-v-somerset-county-cricket-live"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version every Wednesday, just pop your email in below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cricket is not often accused of being short of statistics, but there is one that we hardly ever see. It measures what may be the most sought-after quality in sport: the ability to win. And the least sought-after – the tendency to lose. Welcome to the win/loss ratio, an off-putting name for a crucial metric.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/why-studying-england-winloss-ratio-can-bring-selectors-some-clarity-spin-cricket"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/april-the-kindest-month-as-county-batters-pile-up-the-centuries</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Good pitches, bowlers out of practice and batters unscarred by failure make it a fruitful time for the wavers of the willow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was the sight of Rory Burns’s magnificent mane of brown hair, bouncing behind him as he trundled up to the wicket to deliver a tame dobbler against Warwickshire. Perhaps it was Sir Alastair Cook against Kent, sporting an impish grin as he approached the crease at an angle, his arms fanned out and bent at the elbow before serving a ball high on humour but lacking any bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could have been Michael Burgess’s 178 from No 8 at Edgbaston against Surrey in the opening round of the County Championship season. Or the drawn match in Derby a week later that saw Cheteshwar Pujara, Shan Masood and Tom Haines all manage double tons. Then again it might have been any of the other 32 centuries scored across eight days of domestic cricket. Whatever prompted it, a counterintuitive idea spilled over the horizon and opened our eyes to its inarguable truth: batting in April in England isn’t so difficult after all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/april-the-kindest-month-as-county-batters-pile-up-the-centuries"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;50-year-old taken to hospital after collapsing at a playground&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Campbell played two ODIs for Australia in 2002&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Australia ODI wicketkeeper Ryan Campbell has suffered a heart attack and is in intensive care in a London hospital. The 50-year-old was at a playground with his children at the weekend when he collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news was revealed by 6PR Breakfast host, and close friend of Campbell, Gareth Parker. The pair spent time together when Campbell recently returned home to Perth for a visit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/former-australia-wicketkeeper-ryan-campbell-suffers-heart-attack"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Cricket needs a more modern president’: Lawrence takes on Gloucestershire role | Tanya Aldred</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/18/cricket-david-lawrence-gloucestershire-president-county-championship</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;David ‘Syd’ Lawrence was the first British-born black man to play for England, and now aims to break down more barriers as president of Gloucestershire CCC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David “Syd” Lawrence rises to his feet in a meeting room at Gloucestershire’s Nevil Road ground, right leg in a boot because of an achilles injury. His muscles ripple across his shoulders like Himalayan foothills, his hands colossal hams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is waiting to be unveiled as the club’s next president at that evening’s AGM, the first black president of Gloucestershire and thought to be the first black president at any county. He has big plans to open the game up to people of colour and to children from all backgrounds. “The game has gone through a watershed moment. It’s not looked pretty at all. Historically I suffered racism. And I think it’s important for me as a person of colour to be viewed in the community [to show] that anything is possible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/18/cricket-david-lawrence-gloucestershire-president-county-championship"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rob Key’s remarkable rise is not just a case of a job for the boys | Ali Martin</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/18/rob-keys-remarkable-rise-is-not-just-a-case-of-a-job-for-the-boys</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Former Kent captain turned broadcaster, who has laid down his microphone and put his head on the block as director of men’s cricket, is not to be underestimated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In between England’s ruinous Ashes campaign and the largely dismal epilogue in the Caribbean last month, a panel of Rob Key, Mike Atherton and Nasser Hussain recorded a podcast for Sky in which they analysed the Test team’s myriad problems and discussed how they would change things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key, though supposedly steering the debate as host, was pressed for his views. After detailed responses that have been widely reported over the past few days and which included his belief that player power needs addressing, Atherton joked that the only solution was to take charge of the England set-up himself. “The answer to that is no,” Key replied, amid chuckles from all three.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/18/rob-keys-remarkable-rise-is-not-just-a-case-of-a-job-for-the-boys"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rob Key’s appointment represents a gamble for rudderless England | Mark Ramprakash</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/18/rob-key-appointment-england-cricket-ecb-managing-director</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new managing director of cricket impressed at Sky but his lack of experience is a concern for an ECB lacking leadership&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Key is someone I have known for a very, very, long time. He’s been involved in cricket through his career; as a player, as a captain, and then with Sky, where he has become a prominent voice, somewhat surprisingly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I say surprisingly because they tend to hire former England captains for their main punditry and analysis roles, so Rob was a little bit of an outlier in that sense. But he has grown into the role very well and often comes up with thought-provoking conversations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/18/rob-key-appointment-england-cricket-ecb-managing-director"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Harry Brook’s unbeaten half-century helped Yorkshire reach their target, while  Lancashire finally overcame late Kent resistance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;James Bracey made his second sprightly ton of the season yesterday.&lt;/strong&gt; He’s still at the crease in Bristol and looking in very good on the pull and cover drive. He had a bit of a shocker last summer for England and was written off by some, it is nice to see him back in the runs and putting his name in the mix again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Canterbury and Matt Parkinson is bowling Lancashire to victory&lt;/strong&gt;, but will anyone from England &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; take notice? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/apr/17/gloucestershire-v-yorkshire-kent-v-lancashire-and-more-county-cricket-live"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘An absolute honour’: England appoint Rob Key as director of men’s cricket</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/17/an-absolute-honour-england-appoint-rob-key-as-director-of-mens-cricket</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Former England batter takes helm at ‘challenging time’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ECB’s Tom Harrison: ‘His passion and knowledge is outstanding’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Key will begin working on an overhaul of England’s coaching and selection setup after the former Kent captain turned Sky Sports pundit was named as the new director of men’s cricket on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key has replaced Ashley Giles, who was fired after the winter’s calamitous 4-0 Ashes defeat. With no Test captain or permanent head coach in place, or anyone in charge of selection currently, the 42-year-old has a relatively blank canvas to work with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/17/an-absolute-honour-england-appoint-rob-key-as-director-of-mens-cricket"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Stuart Broad distances himself from interim England cricket captaincy</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/17/stuart-broad-distances-himself-from-interim-england-cricket-captain</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;‘It is not something I have given any thought to,’ says bowler&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Broad suggests Ben Stokes should replace departed Joe Root&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuart Broad has done his best to distance himself from swirling suggestions that he could become England’s next Test captain in the wake of Joe Root stepping down after five years and 64 Tests in charge, with the 35-year-old insisting the role is “not something I have given any thought to” and suggesting Ben Stokes is the leading candidate to replace Root.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broad has been touted as a possible short-term replacement for Root after his announcement on Friday that he was stepping down as England’s Test skipper and while the Nottinghamshire seamer can see why that is the case given his vast experience, and fact he has captained England in both one-day internationals and Twenty20 matches, he does not, for now, appear keen to put himself forward for the job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/17/stuart-broad-distances-himself-from-interim-england-cricket-captain"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Essex had to rely on their final wicket partnership to see them over the line in a low scoring game&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games moving on swiftly: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glamorgan&lt;/strong&gt; all out 379, a led of 62. Matthew Potts takes his third wicket in his third over, &lt;strong&gt;Leicestershire&lt;/strong&gt; have lost three for 12 this morning in a north-east wobble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re in Taunton this morning,&lt;/strong&gt; admission is free - Essex have crept up to 17-4, 67 needed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/apr/16/gloucestershire-v-yorkshire-somerset-v-essex-county-cricket-live"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Stopgap captain could be perfect for England after Joe Root’s overdue exit | Vic Marks</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/16/stopgap-captain-could-be-perfect-for-england-after-joe-roots-overdue-exit</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ECB shouldn’t be afraid of appointing a short-term leader who can steer the side through a challenging summer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/15/joe-roots-sad-but-inevitable-departure-leaves-england-with-huge-gaps-at-the-top" title=""&gt;Joe Root resigned&lt;/a&gt; as England captain and this was one of the better recent days for the England and Wales Cricket Board. It was, at least, one clarification in a fog of uncertainty. There is no chairman at the ECB, no cricket director (though the expectation is that Rob Key will be appointed after the Easter bank holiday), no coach and now no Test captain. Not much room for complacency here. England have not been so rudderless since 1988, the summer of four Test captains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assumption is that Root jumped rather than being pushed since there is no one around at the ECB to push him. Key, as a Sky pundit, has been critical of his captaincy but I doubt that was decisive. Root has had time since the Caribbean tour to think and sit down with his nearest and dearest and he has reached a logical conclusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/16/stopgap-captain-could-be-perfect-for-england-after-joe-roots-overdue-exit"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>ECB’s statistical spin hides the fact that Joe Root was sunk as England captain | Barney Ronay</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/15/joe-root-england-captain-ecb-cricket-comment</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A nice person and an all-time great batsman but after 64 Tests it is still hard to know what a Joe Root side is supposed to look like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a terrifying moment in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner where the crew of the mariner’s ship, lost at sea under a merciless sun, are visited by a mind-blowing vision: a ghost galleon containing only the figure of Death and a sad, pale woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alone on their putrid deck, Death and the sad, pale woman – who to be fair, probably expected something more along the lines of cabaret and a buffet – play an arbitrary game of dice for the lives of the (already dying) crew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/15/joe-root-england-captain-ecb-cricket-comment"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
