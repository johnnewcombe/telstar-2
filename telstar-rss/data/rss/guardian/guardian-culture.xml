      <title>‘It’s just good energy!’ How TikTok and Covid made drum’n’bass hot again</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/its-just-good-energy-how-tiktok-and-covid-made-drumnbass-hot-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 90s genre is being freshened up by young, often female artists mixing hyper-fast breakbeats with soft vocals. But why is it so suited to our post-lockdown, attention-deficient era?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lincoln Barrett started making drum’n’bass tracks in the late 90s, he says, “people were kind of mocking me for being into it. People were already saying drum’n’bass is dead. Going into the record shop in Cardiff, Catapult, you would kind of get the piss taken out of you by people who were, I guess, into trance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He laughs. In the intervening period, Barrett became High Contrast, one of the most respected drum’n’bass producers in the world: he’s about to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his debut album, True Colours. Drum’n’bass, meanwhile, has steadfastly refused to die – in fact, it is enjoying an unexpected moment in the sun, freshening up 2022’s pop music. “It’s people who aren’t really part of the drum’n’bass scene just coming through and doing jungle in their own way, and it’s really in a separate lane from established artists and what drum’n’bass is now,” says Barrett. “It’s amazing that it’s been led mainly by young women artists as well.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/its-just-good-energy-how-tiktok-and-covid-made-drumnbass-hot-again"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Shoot em up! How TV fell in love with video games</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/shoot-em-up-how-tv-fell-in-love-with-video-games</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Halo and Resident Evil to emo apocalypse thriller The Last of Us, video game adaptations are storming our screens. Is this a fast-track to quality TV – or a cynical cash grab?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, it was an accepted truth that video games just didn’t work on screen. Remember the quasi-cyberpunk 1993 Super Mario movie, starring Dennis Hopper? It was so bad that basically &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/mar/22/super-mario-bros-movie-killing-fields-chariots-fire-video-game"&gt;everyone involved with it has disavowed it&lt;/a&gt;. And TV? Kids of the 90s will remember the incredibly annoying voice of Sonic the Hedgehog on Saturday morning TV – or the permanent repeats of the Pokémon anime series – but other than that, the entertainment world never took games seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, though, things are different. In the past few years, Hollywood has managed to produce a few video-game films that are actually watchable, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/03/pokemon-detective-pikachu-review-ryan-reynolds-grabs-film-by-scruff-of-the-neck"&gt;Detective Pikachu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-review-no-surprises-in-segas-speedy-critter-sequel"&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&lt;/a&gt;. And barely a week goes by without an announcement that another game has been picked up for TV – all of which are aimed at adults, not kids or tweens. There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/24/halo-review-hit-sci-fi-game-tv-series"&gt;science fiction series based on Halo&lt;/a&gt;, the first-person shooter from 2001 whose original fans are well into their 30s and beyond. There’s a Netflix adaptation of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/assassin-s-creed"&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/a&gt;, the historical action game that makes you run around in elaborate simulations of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/assassins-creed-origins-recreated-ancient-egypt-ubisoft"&gt;ancient Egypt&lt;/a&gt; or Renaissance Italy – which adds to the streaming giant’s 15-rated take on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/17/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;The Witcher&lt;/a&gt;, starring Henry Cavill, which is almost as filthy and violent as its source material. And in an Inception-level example of games and TV inspiring each other, there’s even a series based on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/09/cuphead-review-game-visuals-thrills-1930s-animation"&gt;Cuphead&lt;/a&gt;, a well-loved but niche run-and-gun game that is itself a homage to early 1920s cartoons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/shoot-em-up-how-tv-fell-in-love-with-video-games"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Villanelle will be back!’ Killing Eve’s author speaks out over the catastrophic TV finale</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/killing-eve-writer-tv-finale</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The characters I created on the page have been a lifeline to so many. But I have words of comfort for fans devastated by its punishing ending&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: this piece contains spoilers from the Killing Eve season four finale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an author, it’s a thrill having your work adapted for TV, as my Killing Eve novels were. You’re never going to love everything the screenwriting team does, that’s a given. You’re too close to the characters. You’ve lived with them in your head for far too long. But it’s a thrill to see your story taken in unexpected directions, overlaid with a great soundtrack (thank you David Holmes and Unloved) and dressed fantastically (that unforgettable pink tulle dress by Molly Goddard).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/killing-eve-writer-tv-finale"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Margo Jefferson on Will Smith, TikTok and identity: ‘I don’t like the sense that we are so fragile’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/22/margo-jefferson-on-will-smith-tiktok-and-identity-i-dont-like-the-sense-that-we-are-so-fragile</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of her new memoir, the critic talks about her current pop culture obsessions and why she identifies with Nina Simone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/30/will-smith-chris-rock-oscars-slap"&gt;Will Smith slapped&lt;/a&gt; Chris Rock at the Academy Awards ceremony last month Margo Jefferson had stepped away from her TV for a moment. Like millions of us, she watched it on replay, absorbing the sheer novelty of a normally stage-managed spectacle collapsing into chaos. As it happened, the incident crystallised several Jeffersonian themes: televised glamour, Black entertainers, and the question of how to behave in public. In her &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/03/negroland-a-memoir-margo-jefferson-review"&gt;2016 memoir Negroland&lt;/a&gt;, about the lifestyles and mores of the Black elite in mid-century America, Jefferson recalls her parents dissecting the TV performances of Sammy Davis Jr, Dorothy Dandridge and Lena Horne, and describes the oppressive power of the dictum “everything we do must reflect well on the race”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But times have moved on, she believes. Both Rock’s routine, in which he joked about Smith’s wife, Jada, and Smith’s response struck her as immature more than anything else. “They’re too old,” she sighs. “They are definitely too old and they should be too astute for these shenanigans.” Speaking to me from her apartment in New York’s West Village, in which the only physical objects appear to be books, she says: “That kind of old ‘respectability’ question did not really enter into it for me.” Why not? “Black culture, and our range of behavioural possibilities and choices, has expanded.” Judged as a performance, however – the critic in her is rarely stilled for long – it was simply cheap, juvenile, “staged hood theatrics”. “I wish it had been handled by Jada herself.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/22/margo-jefferson-on-will-smith-tiktok-and-identity-i-dont-like-the-sense-that-we-are-so-fragile"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Production of Being Mortal suspended by studio Searchlight while an investigation is being conducted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A complaint of “inappropriate behaviour” has been made against the actor Bill Murray, leading to the production shutdown of the film he is working on, it has been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2022/04/being-mortal-bill-murray-1235007590/"&gt;According to Deadline&lt;/a&gt;, production on the Searchlight film Being Mortal was halted on Monday and a letter was subsequently sent to cast and crew saying: “We were made aware of a complaint, and we immediately looked into it.

      <title>Cruise v Titchmarsh: a right royal smackdown at the Queen’s platinum jubilee</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/22/tom-cruise-v-alan-titchmarsh-smackdown-at-the-queens-platinum-jubilee</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eyebrows have been raised with the announcement that the Tom Cruise will host part of the celebration – but can anything see off the Gardeners’ World heavyweight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this stage it’s honestly hard to know what the Queen thinks of her imminent platinum jubilee. On the one hand, the outpouring of patriotic pageantry will provide a perfect distraction from all the terrible things her family keeps doing. But on the other, she’s going to have to sit through an awful lot of faff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, the centrepiece of this faff was announced. Set within the grounds of Windsor Castle, the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebration will take place in front of a live audience of 4,000, and reportedly cover 400 years of British history. Helen Mirren will play Queen Elizabeth I and deliver a speech from 1588. There will be a long section about the Gunpowder Plot. There will be a lot of horses; 500 of them, in fact. And Katherine Jenkins. And Ant and Dec. It sounds tortuous. The Queen has had to put up with this sort of thing for 70 years now. You can’t help but feel that she’d probably just prefer a quiet night in with the snooker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/22/tom-cruise-v-alan-titchmarsh-smackdown-at-the-queens-platinum-jubilee"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Canals, charcuterie and beer: the weird ways record shops are staying afloat</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/canals-charcuterie-and-beer-how-record-shops-are-staying-afloat</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend’s Record Store Day will give indie shops a cash boost – but it’s not enough. UK shopkeepers explain why they’re diversifying to survive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A little more than a decade ago, the decline of the British record shop looked terminal. But, in a dramatic turnaround, numbers doubled in the first half of the 2010s, and even now, after Covid lockdowns, they are at levels not seen since the 1990s: 407 independent stores were counted in 2021. Since it came to the UK in 2008, Record Store Day – &lt;a href="https://recordstoreday.co.uk/"&gt;celebrated this weekend&lt;/a&gt; – has gone from having the sense of a charity appeal for the afflicted, to one of the biggest music industry beanfeasts in the calendar. But behind the vinyl hype, things remain precarious, and a record shop now is rarely just a record shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s commonplace for them to also be cafes or bars. But how about one with a built-in radio station (Some Great Reward in Glasgow or the Book and Record Bar in West Norwood)? Or with a bakery renowned for its pie and mash (Coffee and Vinyl in Torquay), an entire charcuterie counter (Bradford’s Record Café – whose blunt Yorkshire slogan is “Vinyl, Ale, Ham”), or an organic brewery and record label all in a stable block (Futtle, on the outskirts of a Fife fishing village)? How about one that exists for only a day each month and is as much party as shop (the Re:Warm pop-up in a Bournemouth bike shop-cafe), or one which is also the owner’s home (The Record Deck): a barge, setting up stall wherever it finds itself on the canal system?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/canals-charcuterie-and-beer-how-record-shops-are-staying-afloat"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Silence guarantees nothing will change’: film-makers challenge the anti-abortion movement</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/22/silence-guarantees-nothing-will-change-film-makers-challenge-the-anti-abortion-movement</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Audrey Diwan’s 1960s-set drama Happening is the latest in a wave of films on an issue that is increasingly topical&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Audrey Diwan first started writing a script about abortion, people would ask her why. Adapting Annie Ernaux’s memoir about the author’s struggle to obtain an illegal abortion as a student in 1960s France, Diwan knew the story was important, but it was difficult to persuade others of its relevance. Fast forward a few years, and no one is asking why. When &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/20/happening-review-cleverly-structured-and-impeccably-produced-abortion-drama"&gt;Happening&lt;/a&gt; premiered at the Venice film festival last year, critics were quick to draw connections between the plight of Anne (the character in the film) and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/12/oklahoma-governor-signs-bill-nearly-all-abortion-illegal"&gt;tightening of abortion restrictions&lt;/a&gt; around the world. As it lands in UK cinemas this week, this period piece feels timelier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happening arrives on our screens at a fraught moment. In the US, Republicans are continuing &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/08/oklahomas-move-to-ban-abortions-is-a-prelude-of-america-without-roe-v-wade"&gt;a prolonged legislative assault on abortion&lt;/a&gt; as the supreme court waits to pass judgment on a case which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/11/supreme-court-roe-v-wade-gay-rights-contraceptives-fertility-treatments"&gt;could overturn Roe v Wade&lt;/a&gt;. In Europe, the debate around abortion access has been &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/21/pills-in-the-post-how-covid-reopened-the-abortion-wars"&gt;regalvanised by the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-55838210"&gt;last year Poland&lt;/a&gt; passed a near total ban, making it the sixth European country to impose severe restrictions. Elsewhere we’ve seen a swing in the opposite direction, with moves towards decriminalisation in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/22/colombia-legalises-abortion-in-move-celebrated-as-historic-victory-by-campaigners"&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/30/argentina-legalises-abortion-in-landmark-moment-for-womens-rights"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/sep/09/mexico-ruling-decriminalise-abortion-activists"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. The overall effect of this push-pull is an atmosphere of intense instability as we face up to a new phase in the struggle for reproductive justice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/22/silence-guarantees-nothing-will-change-film-makers-challenge-the-anti-abortion-movement"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>From Gaslit to Ten Percent: the seven best shows to stream this week</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/from-gaslit-to-ten-percent-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Julia Roberts stars in a drama about an all-too-prescient political scandal, and the British remake of Call My Agent! gets off to a celeb-studded start&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawless political party, cut adrift from morality and plumbing the depths to cling to power? &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/aug/13/dan-stevens-the-bodice-ripper-never-quite-goes-away-i-dont-think-it-ever-will"&gt;Dan Stevens&lt;/a&gt; (who plays Republican aide turned prosecution witness John Dean) has already drawn a parallel between Richard Nixon’s Watergate administration, the subject of this eight-part series, and the current UK government. Even if it wasn’t so timely, this drama would still be a striking warning from history. It’s a fresh angle on familiar material, with Julia Roberts as Martha Mitchell – the wife of Nixon’s corrupt attorney general John (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/seanpenn"&gt;Sean Penn&lt;/a&gt;), who helped blow the whistle on the scandal and suffered grievously as a result (namely kidnap and sedation). It’s bleak but often darkly funny. &lt;em&gt;PH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;StarzPlay, from Sunday 24 April&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/from-gaslit-to-ten-percent-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

A very sexy waste. But Dornan’s deep, Northern Irish tones transport you to a Mexico beach and a desert storm, complete with swooshy sound effects, as he works his sleepy witchcraft – and it does work. With six episodes to choose from, this is definitely not one to listen to in the middle of a meeting. &lt;em&gt;Hannah Verdier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/21/hear-here-tiffany-dover-isnt-dead-covid-podcast"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>UK publishers take £6.7bn in sales as TikTok crazes fuel purchases</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/21/uk-publishers-take-67bn-in-sales-as-tiktok-crazes-fuel-purchases</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The social media platform was a surprise driver for new and older books as sales rose 5% for print and digital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK publishing’s total income reached a new high of £6.7bn in 2021, up 5% from 2020. This growth comes despite – or perhaps because of – the pandemic, with the social media platform &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/17/it-is-surreal-the-five-second-book-reviews-going-viral-on-tiktok"&gt;TikTok emerging as a surprise driving force&lt;/a&gt; not only for new books, but backlist purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Covid lockdowns forced bookshops to close and subsequent supply chain issues caused delays and headaches for publishers, the appetite for reading soared, with sales up by 5% year on year for both print and digital books, while audiobooks continued the “stellar” performance of recent years with a 14% rise in sales, according to a report from the Publishers Association.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/21/uk-publishers-take-67bn-in-sales-as-tiktok-crazes-fuel-purchases"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

His most well known role was as Bert Cooper, the head of the show’s advertising agency, who gave his surname to the company Sterling Cooper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a career spanning nearly 60 years, he appeared in about 100 theatre, TV and film productions, having first made his name in 1961 in a stage adaptation of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, based on Shepherd Mead’s best-selling book – for which he won the Tony award for best actor in a musical.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/21/robert-morse-star-of-mad-men-and-broadway-dies-aged-90"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Obamas’ media company Higher Ground reportedly seeking new partner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barack and Michelle Obama are leaving Spotify amid reports of frustration over the terms of their multimillion dollar deal to exclusively make podcasts with the streaming giant, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obamas announced in 2019 they would partner exclusively with Spotify to release podcasts through their media company Higher Ground, in a deal rumoured to be worth $25m. Renegades: Born in the USA, Barack Obama’s show with musician Bruce Springsteen, and The Michelle Obama Podcast, have both been successes for Spotify.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/21/barack-and-michelle-obama-to-end-exclusive-podcasting-deal-with-spotify-reports-say"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Musician was one of the first people of African descent to have visual and written record in Britain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is the most famous Black person from the Tudor era, a court trumpeter who performed at important regal celebrations and was highly rewarded for his skill by Henry VIII.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the story of John Blanke, one of the first people of African descent to have both a visual and written record in Britain, will be told at a major exhibition at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/20/story-of-henry-viiis-black-trumpeter-to-be-told-at-walker-art-gallery-in-liverpool"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Claire Rousay: Everything Perfect Is Already Here review – everyday sounds that tug at the heartstrings</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/claire-rousay-everything-perfect-is-already-here-review-everyday-sounds-that-tug-at-the-heartstrings</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Shelter Press)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The San Antonio-based artist uses field recordings of lighters and typewriters, voice fragments and classical instrumentation to evoke emotion and memory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “emo ambient” tag seems to have stuck for the music of emergent San Antonio artist &lt;a href="https://clairerousay.com/"&gt;Claire Rousay&lt;/a&gt;, and in all fairness, it fits pretty well. Her work, at its core, is an experiment in using commonplace environmental sounds to tug at the heartstrings directly. Across her quickly growing discography, field recordings of lighters, typewriters and other domestic paraphernalia seamlessly mingle with voice recordings, text-to-speech and the hesitant harmonics of classical instrumentation and drone. Under her direction, these components seem to coalesce into something more than a mere meeting of acoustics and textures, evoking emotion, memory and a striking sense of vulnerability in the listening experience. This is music for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/28/pauline-oliveros-deep-listening-dead-obituary"&gt;Oliveros&lt;/a&gt;-inspired deep listeners and for poets finding meaning among the mundane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On her latest record, Everything Perfect Is Already Here, Rousay welcomes melodic elements into her compositions: on It Feels Foolish to Care, wandering harp progressions join slumbering violins, voices and laughter, and possibly paper rustles and poured liquids; a piano refrain drops in towards the end without buildup, tender yet sudden enough to hit like a stunner out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/claire-rousay-everything-perfect-is-already-here-review-everyday-sounds-that-tug-at-the-heartstrings"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Tonight’s Homework review – Kiarostami-inspired snapshot of Iran’s wealth gap</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/22/tonights-homework-review-kiarostami-inspired-snapshot-of-irans-wealth-gap</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inequality is exposed in a series of interviews with schoolkids in a heartbreaking doc that echoes Abbas Kiarostami’s documentary Homework&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cheeky-faced boy of seven or eight is asked what he would wish for. “A big bike and a balloon that never bursts!” he replies with a huge grin, tickled with his answer. Another boy around the same age, more shabbily dressed and serious looking, is asked what life is about. He chews his bottom lip: “Life is something that is filled with difficulty.” This often heartbreaking, painful documentary from Ashkan Nejati and Mehran Nematollahi has a simple premise: interviewing Iranian schoolkids to camera about their lives, school, homework and hopes for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a sequel of sorts to godfather of modern Iranian cinema &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/apr/16/art"&gt;Abbas Kiarostami’s 1989 documentary Homework&lt;/a&gt;, which put the same questions to children growing up in the shadow of the Iran-Iraq war. The new film features plenty of kids-say-the-funniest-things moments. A boy is asked which countries he’d like to visit? “Europe, America … Neptune!” And there’s some commentary on the Iranian education system. But what lingers is the film’s devastating snapshot of the gap between rich and poor. One of the rich kids, a placid round-faced boy, brags about how well-off his dad is and how many cars they’ve got. The interviewer gently probes him: do you know what wealth is? “Yes, someone who has a lot of cash like my dad.” Do you know what poverty is? “No.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/22/tonights-homework-review-kiarostami-inspired-snapshot-of-irans-wealth-gap"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Grimeboy review – a pair of battling MCs become allies</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/21/grimeboy-review-birmingham-rep</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birmingham Rep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Casey Bailey’s moving, emotionally honest grime musical grows in power and has its own poetic, street-smart presence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grimeboy starts off with a deceptive lightness as a coming-of-age story sprinkled with humour, comical male braggadocio and thumping bass. The stage is decked out with speakers and a DJ (Auden Allen) mixes at his turntable. It is a sign that Casey Bailey’s gritty, moving play will come heavily laden with the sounds of grime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it does, with its three actors telling the story partly through “spitting” lyrics, all of them as talented at rapping as each other. Directed by Madeleine Kludje, the story revolves around two aspiring grime MCs – Grimeboy (Keiren Hamilton-Amos) and his protege Blue (Alexander Lobo Moreno). They begin as adversaries at a grime battle but soon become firm allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grimeboy is at &lt;a href="https://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/whats-on/grimeboy/"&gt;Birmingham Rep&lt;/a&gt; until 30 April.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/21/grimeboy-review-birmingham-rep"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Yuja Wang /Royal festival hall review – dazzling and brilliant playing</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/21/yuja-wang-review-royal-festival-hall-london-dazzling-and-brilliant-playing</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Royal Festival Hall, London&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Wang’s flamboyance and virtuosity doesn’t always convey a real sense of what the music is about, but in works such as  Ligeti’s Etudes she is irresistible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Touchingly, &lt;a href="http://yujawang.com/"&gt;Yuja Wang&lt;/a&gt; dedicated her latest London appearance to the memory of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/19/radu-lupu-piano-five-key-performances"&gt;Radu Lupu&lt;/a&gt;, who had died three days earlier. But it’s hard to imagine two more dissimilar pianists than the flamboyant, brilliantly virtuosic Chinese and the retiring, reticent Romanian, for whom keyboard technique was only ever a means to an expressive, poetic end, and never an end in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Wang’s playing is still mostly about surfaces. That she has the potential to make her playing more searching, though, was clear at several points during this recital, for which there was no printed programme, just a list of the works being played. Apparently she had not wanted to commit herself in advance and to be as flexible as possible in what she intended to play, although in the event what we did hear, before a flurry of encores, was exactly what had been listed on the Southbank Centre’s website for a number of weeks before the concert.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/21/yuja-wang-review-royal-festival-hall-london-dazzling-and-brilliant-playing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Henry VI: Rebellion / Wars of the Roses review – thrilling games of thrones</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/21/henry-vi-rebellion-wars-of-the-roses-review-thrilling-games-of-thrones</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;With their portrait of a wobbling monarchy and egotistical leadership, these rare stagings are particularly topical&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three plays about King Henry VI rank low in the Shakespearean canon for character and poetry but paradoxically have the heaviest popular culture presence, as an acknowledged source for the regicidal TV epic &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/game-of-thrones-episode-by-episode"&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/a&gt;. The middle drama also contains one of Shakespeare’s most quoted lines, “the first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers,” spoken by an ally of Jack Cade, the populist demagogue who, as proxy for the Yorkists, threatens the House of Lancaster’s hold on the throne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The production by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/14/experience-shakespeare-by-seeing-it-even-better-be-in-it-inside-the-rscs-new-epic"&gt;Owen Horsley&lt;/a&gt; (RSC boss &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gregory-doran"&gt;Gregory Doran&lt;/a&gt;, on compassionate leave, is “consultant director”) imposes no strenuous topicalities but is alert to the fact that a wobbling monarchy and the vulnerability of a populace to muscular false promise particularly chime with this revival. Shakespeare covers most human and political possibilities and, through Cade, skewers the year zero egotists of which Boris Johnson is the latest exemplar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/21/henry-vi-rebellion-wars-of-the-roses-review-thrilling-games-of-thrones"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>National Dance Company Wales review – comedy and menace with rumbling tums and giant steps</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/21/national-dance-company-wales-review-comedy-and-menace-with-rumbling-tums-and-giant-steps</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Place, London&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A triple bill from this bright young company features entertainingly noisy body parts, a hint of disaster and some absurdist chaos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NDC Wales are a very likable bunch of dancers to spend a couple of hours with, a versatile group of 10 distinct young performers in a triple bill that shows their range. The most easily engaging piece is Andrea Costanzo Martini’s Wild Thoughts, set partly to Matthew Herbert’s track Foreign Bodies, made with sounds sampled from the human body. After the dancers have amusingly catalogued their body parts in intricate rhythm, a rumbling of innards sets off a new skein of movement, as if led by gurgling intestines. There is plenty of dancing skill, as well as entertainment value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most ambitious work is Codi, by Anthony Matsena, with input from his writer brother Kel. The fast-rising Matsena brothers were born in Zimbabwe and brought up in Wales, and here they delve into Welsh mining history. The stage is sometimes lit only by the dancers’ head torches, and the result is murky in more ways than one. There are fleeting scenes – pride, anger and strident protest, a draconian foreman, voices talking of being trapped, bodies piled in a heap: the Aberfan disaster instantly comes to mind but the details of the stories Matsena is drawing on are not revealed. In parallel, Matsena harnesses the energy of the dancers in forthright unison, using the glitch and pop and hard accents of hip-hop, ending on a note of triumph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/21/national-dance-company-wales-review-comedy-and-menace-with-rumbling-tums-and-giant-steps"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Opolis review – generation-gap drama plunges deep into virtual world</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/21/opolis-review-generation-gap-drama-alphabetti-theatre-newcastle</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alphabetti theatre, Newcastle&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The possibility of trading bad memories for good drives tension in this disconcerting play by Ali Pritchard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they talk about the pre-crisis times in Ali Pritchard’s dystopian two-hander, there is no shortage of options for which crisis they mean. It could be Covid-19, global heating or warring superpowers. Whichever it is, capitalism has ploughed voraciously on. Where once the industrial machine was content to profit from our labour, now it is after our very souls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The play starts, though, with a familiar generational schism. Two women, Julie and Isabel, are squaring up to each other in a claustrophobic space delineated by a simple scaffolding box. Julie is irritated by the time the younger woman spends online. Isabel is outraged to be instructed by someone responsible – by dint of her age – for the decay that has made real life so intolerable. It is less about lacking empathy than mutual incomprehension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opolis is at &lt;a href="https://www.alphabettitheatre.co.uk/"&gt;Alphabetti theatre, Newcastle&lt;/a&gt;, until 7 May.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/21/opolis-review-generation-gap-drama-alphabetti-theatre-newcastle"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Your industry skills are transferable – and five other reasons to teach in further education</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/further-education-share-your-skills/2022/jan/28/your-industry-skills-are-transferable-and-five-other-reasons-to-teach-in-further-education</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From inspiring the next generation to earning while you train, further education teaching offers benefits aplenty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to make more of what you know in 2022, look no further. The Department for Education’s new further education (FE) teacher recruitment campaign and digital service aims to attract skilled industry professionals from a number of key sectors – including construction, engineering and manufacturing, legal, finance and accounting, digital/IT and health and social care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FE is study, usually for learners 16+, that takes place after secondary school in FE colleges and other providers. It can be the next step for young people and school leavers but is equally accessible to adults looking to broaden their skills or change careers. There are a wide range of subjects on offer, with a unique offering of technical and vocational courses that aim to equip learners with practical, work-based skills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/further-education-share-your-skills/2022/jan/28/your-industry-skills-are-transferable-and-five-other-reasons-to-teach-in-further-education"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I’m blessed to have the best of both worlds’: how one busy mum found balance with a portfolio career</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/further-education-share-your-skills/2022/mar/02/im-blessed-to-have-the-best-of-both-worlds-how-one-busy-mum-found-balance-with-a-portfolio-career</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A part-time role teaching in further education gave mother-of-four Mehnaz Ibrahim-Khan the flexibility to work around family life – and her industry job&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mehnaz Ibrahim-Khan is always on the go. When the 34-year-old isn’t looking after her four children, aged one to 10, she’s at one of her two part-time jobs. “As a parent, I am very used to multitasking and switching from one thing to the next,” she says. “The trick is to be as organised as possible and plan ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After studying for a degree in business management, Ibrahim-Khan got a job as a junior accounts receivable administrator at a security firm. Fast-forward 10 years, and she’s worked her way up to a multifaceted role working across multiple departments. “As it’s a small business, I’m expected to wear different hats all the time and adapt my skillset as the business grows,” she says. “I now manage the whole accounts department, overseeing accounts receivable and accounts payable, along with liaising with our accountants. I’m also in charge of HR and payroll, and assist on the marketing and sales side of things too.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/further-education-share-your-skills/2022/mar/02/im-blessed-to-have-the-best-of-both-worlds-how-one-busy-mum-found-balance-with-a-portfolio-career"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Teaching in further education alongside his industry job gave an IT expert the variety he craved</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/further-education-share-your-skills/2022/feb/24/teaching-in-further-education-alongside-his-industry-job-gave-an-it-expert-the-variety-he-craved</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keen for a new challenge, IT professional Christian Nunez Fuentes took a course at Bedford college … and soon ended up teaching there himself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christian Nunez Fuentes’s path into further education (FE) has been one of twists and turns. Brought up in Peru, at the age of 22 he moved to the UK to study English – a language he proceeded to learn from scratch. That led to a 13-year career in retail IT, initially as a technician and then as a business account manager and supervisor, in areas such as customer service, logistics and sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deciding it was time for a change, in 2016 Nunez Fuentes set up his own web design company. At the same time he took a Higher National Certificate (HNC) and Higher National Diploma (HND) in computing and systems development at Bedford college, an FE provider based in the town of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working in the industry as well as teaching lets Nunez Fuentes keep on top of the latest developments, benefiting his students&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/further-education-share-your-skills/2022/feb/24/teaching-in-further-education-alongside-his-industry-job-gave-an-it-expert-the-variety-he-craved"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Behind the Shop Facade: the life and times of Maurice Dorfman | photo essay</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/14/behind-the-shop-facade-the-life-and-times-of-maurice-dorfman</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last 18 months, the photographer Jim Grover has been piecing together the life of Maurice Dorfman, who died in February 2020, aged 87, in his project &lt;a href="https://www.behindtheshopfacade.com/"&gt;Behind the Shop Facade&lt;/a&gt;. A grandchild of Ukrainian refugees who fled pogroms at the turn of the century, Maurice ran Jeannette Fashions, a traditional haberdashery shop and the longest surviving independent shop on Clapham High Street&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.behindtheshopfacade.com/when-and-where"&gt;Exhibition in tribute to Maurice&lt;/a&gt; until to the end of April at Clapham Library&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More than 60 people have shared their memories and mementoes with me, such is the breadth and depth of affection for Maurice in the local community, and the desire to help me create a fitting tribute,” says the south-London photograher about Maurice Dorfman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tucked away in one of Maurice’s cupboards, I stumbled across some dust-encrusted boxes which contained a collection of early 1960s Kodachrome slides of family life. I have had them restored especially for the exhibition; they are wonderfully evocative of sixties life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/14/behind-the-shop-facade-the-life-and-times-of-maurice-dorfman"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
