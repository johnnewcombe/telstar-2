      <title>England’s Simon Middleton issues warning to new Black Ferns coach Smith</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/simon-middleton-black-ferns-coach-wayne-smith-womens-rugby-union</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;England head coach emphasises difference in women’s game&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;‘The men’s culture is a different psyche, different approach’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Middleton has issued a warning to his newly installed New Zealand counterpart, Wayne Smith, suggesting that experience coaching men’s rugby does not necessarily translate in the elite women’s game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, a former All Blacks coach and widely considered one of the most astute minds in the sport, has been appointed director of rugby of the Black Ferns six months out from a home World Cup. The former All Blacks scrum coach Mike Cron has also been brought in, as has the 2011 World Cup-winning coach Sir Graham Henry in a supporting role. All three were involved in the 2011 triumph, but Middleton is not convinced the move will yield immediate success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/simon-middleton-black-ferns-coach-wayne-smith-womens-rugby-union"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Who holds the aces as the race for the Premiership title hots up? | Robert Kitson</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/race-for-the-premiership-title-hots-up-rugby-union</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four key questions before leaders Leicester travel to champions Harlequins and Saracens host Exeter this weekend&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest compliment you can currently pay Leicester is that they are playing like an international team. Steve Borthwick has worked for long enough at the right hand of Eddie Jones in Japan and England to know the importance of being tough to play against as well as supremely fit. He has also gathered some shrewd tactical lieutenants around him and the uplift in Tigers’ efficiency has been conspicuous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/race-for-the-premiership-title-hots-up-rugby-union"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘We can’t stop talking about them’: Fijiana Drua revolutionise women’s rugby in Australia</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/we-cant-stop-talking-about-them-fijiana-drua-revolutionise-womens-rugby-in-australia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The team is set to play in Saturday’s Super W grand final after electrifying fans with giantkilling feats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Captain Cook spent time in Fiji in 1774, he and his crew were astounded by the “drua” – double-hulled boats that were then some of the most advanced sea vessels in the world. Elegant in their simplicity, they were created by binding together buabua trees, not with nails but by “magimagi”, or coconut fibres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this shipbuilding genius went into decline, but nearly 250 years later, Fijians re-emerged as the world’s best – not in the water this time, but on the rugby sevens field. And now, in 2022, the ancient trailblazers have again risen in the 15-a-side version of the game, courtesy of the Fijiana Drua’s debut in the women’s Super W competition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/we-cant-stop-talking-about-them-fijiana-drua-revolutionise-womens-rugby-in-australia"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I know what I can do’: Louis Rees-Zammit finding form with Gloucester</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/21/louis-rees-zammit-wales-six-nations-gloucester-premiership-rugby</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gloucester and Wales wing suffered during the Six Nations but is determined to get back to his best at his club&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this year’s Six Nations, lightning did not strike twice. Whereas Louis Rees-Zammit blazed his way through his debut championship in 2021, he failed to score a try and was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/24/wales-drop-louis-rees-zammit-and-recall-tony-faletau-for-england-clash" title=""&gt;axed for Wales’s key match against England&lt;/a&gt;. His Gloucester director of rugby, George Skivington, sums up nicely the predicament the 21-year-old winger found himself in: “When you’re one of the poster boys of the game, everybody knows when you’ve been dropped.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It represented a first major setback for Rees-Zammit, the youngest member of last year’s British &amp;amp; Irish Lions squad, but one that he dwelled on for all of five minutes. He does not lack for self‑belief, repeatedly insisting “I know what I can do”, but Skivington sees a more rounded player who still has considerable room to improve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/21/louis-rees-zammit-wales-six-nations-gloucester-premiership-rugby"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>England to face Scotland and Wales host Ireland in 2023 Six Nations openers</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/england-to-face-scotland-and-wales-host-ireland-in-2023-six-nations-openers</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Next year’s competition will not feature Friday match&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;England conclude campaign with trip to Ireland&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;a href="https://www.sixnationsrugby.com/2022/04/20/2023-guinness-six-nations-fixtures-announced/" title=""&gt;2023 men’s Six Nations fixtures&lt;/a&gt; look familiar it is because the organisers seem to be allergic to change. The list of games for the championship next year is all but identical to the 2021 schedule, save for a couple of tweaked kick-off times, and is almost precisely the same as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/22/breakdown-six-nations-verdict-rugby-union-france" title=""&gt;the 2022 French-dominated tournament&lt;/a&gt; that concluded last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the third consecutive year England will play Scotland and Wales will meet Ireland on the opening weekend, the only notable tweak being the reversal of the final two rounds of games. Rather than England ending up in Paris again they are due to head to Dublin for their last tournament outing before the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/england-to-face-scotland-and-wales-host-ireland-in-2023-six-nations-openers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/joe-biden-us-rugby-world-cup-bid-letter-bill-beaumont</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;President says US can deliver ‘most successful’ rugby events in history, for men in 2031 and women in 2033, with decision in May&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A letter from Joe Biden to Sir Bill Beaumont, &lt;a href="https://www.world.rugby/news/568870"&gt;chairman&lt;/a&gt; of World Rugby, was part of a finalised World Cup package submitted by USA Rugby in its &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/24/usa-rugby-world-cup-host-2031-2033-may-half-billion-dollars-biden-white-house"&gt;bid&lt;/a&gt; to host the men’s event in 2031 and the women two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World Rugby is due to announce the success or not of the US bid on 12 May. Alan Gilpin, chief executive of the governing body, has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/24/usa-rugby-world-cup-host-2031-2033-may-half-billion-dollars-biden-white-househttps://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/24/usa-rugby-world-cup-host-2031-2033-may-half-billion-dollars-biden-white-house"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; World Rugby believes it “can deliver the right outcomes with this hosting plan”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/joe-biden-us-rugby-world-cup-bid-letter-bill-beaumont"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Blackouts, migraines and amnesia: why a rugby player gave up the game he loved | Andy Bull</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/20/blackouts-migraines-amnesia-why-rugby-union-player-gave-up-game-he-loved</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Humphrey Bodington is about to run 14 marathons in seven days to raise awareness of brain injuries in rugby union&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humphrey Bodington doesn’t remember the collision that led him to give up rugby. He can recall the moments before it, how, playing for Newcastle University, he came hot off the back of the first scrum because he wanted to put in an early shot on the opposition. And he can recall the moments after, the way he woke flat on his back, saw the team’s physio standing over him, and how he thought to himself in that split-second “never again” but nothing in between. He didn’t listen to himself. Two weeks later he played again and suffered another concussion. After that the blackouts and migraines started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodington found he could not concentrate in his lectures and that he was especially sensitive to loud noises. He had also injured his anterior cruciate ligament and had to take nine months out of the game to recover. His doctor told him it was a blessing in disguise because it would give his brain time to heal. With his ACL he could see the swelling go down and feel the pain start to go away, but the concussion wasn’t like that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/20/blackouts-migraines-amnesia-why-rugby-union-player-gave-up-game-he-loved"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Courtney Lawes could miss rest of the season with ‘nasty’ hand injury</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back-row to see specialist over injury, Northampton confirm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thumb dislocated in Challenge Cup defeat by Gloucester&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The England captain Courtney Lawes is set to see a specialist to determine whether he will play again this season after sustaining a “nasty” hand injury, Northampton’s director of rugby, Chris Boyd, has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawes sustained a compound dislocation of his left thumb in the European Challenge Cup quarter‑final defeat by Gloucester last Saturday and was replaced after just 15 minutes. Boyd did not put any sort of time-frame on the 33-year-old’s recovery, stating only that he will definitely not be in contention for the Premiership match against Bath on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/courtney-lawes-hand-injury-northampton-rugby-union"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Harlequins urge Marcus Smith to ‘bounce back’ from European agony</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/harlequins-urge-marcus-smith-to-bounce-back-from-european-agony</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;England fly-half missed late conversion in Champions Cup exit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coach Tabai Matson insists Smith will ‘learn from experience’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcus Smith has been told he cannot dwell on Harlequins’ agonising European exit if he and the club wish to retain their domestic Premiership crown this season. Quins are due to host the league leaders Leicester this weekend and their senior coach Tabai Matson is urging the England fly-half to shake off last weekend’s disappointment as swiftly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matson has revealed his players were so gutted about their &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/16/harlequins-montpellier-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report"&gt;one-point aggregate defeat against Montpellier&lt;/a&gt; that afternoon training this week was replaced by a light-hearted game of cricket to bolster morale. Smith was as disappointed as anyone having missed a crucial late conversion but his coaches have challenged him to bounce back immediately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/harlequins-urge-marcus-smith-to-bounce-back-from-european-agony"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Breakdown | Marcus Smith’s gut-twisting dismay could yet be making of his career</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/marcus-smith-gut-twisting-dismay-could-yet-be-making-of-his-career-the-breakdown</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Harlequins fly-half endured the worst of moments but elite sport always requires an ability to bounce back from failure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to The Breakdown, the Guardian’s weekly (and free) rugby union newsletter. Here’s an extract from this week’s edition. To receive the full version every Tuesday, just pop your email in below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing top-level sport, in the end, is less about talent than the ability to bounce back from failure. “I’ve failed over and over again in my life and that’s why I succeed,” said the great Michael Jordan, who knew a little about turning talent into consistent achievement. There is not a single great athlete who, at one stage or another, has not experienced a jolt of gut-twisting dismay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/19/marcus-smith-gut-twisting-dismay-could-yet-be-making-of-his-career-the-breakdown"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Champions Cup fulfils promise and serves up tasty quarter-final menu</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/17/champions-cup-fulfils-promise-and-serves-up-tasty-quarter-final-menu</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One side of the draw features a selection of Europe’s most renowned clubs who share a combined 13 previous titles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s Champions Cup has delivered a quarter-final lineup worthy of the competition’s grand standing in the game. Montpellier, Leicester and Leinster – respectively leaders of the French and English leagues plus the multinational United Championship – are there. Toulouse, the Champions Cup holders and most successful club in the tournament’s history with five wins, are also in the mix, as are La Rochelle, finalists last season, and the two-times winners Munster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a mismatch in the draw as one side of the equation is stacked with past champions while the other half can point only to four unsuccessful finals as a sign of their collective continental pedigree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/17/champions-cup-fulfils-promise-and-serves-up-tasty-quarter-final-menu"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>England and France lead way but women’s rugby is being badly let down elsewhere | Ali Donnelly</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/17/england-france-lead-way-women-rugby-let-down-black-ferns</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Depressing report into the state of the Black Ferns highlights problems even as move towards professionalisation accelerates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;England’s success at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/england-and-jess-breach-power-past-wales-to-set-up-six-nations-finale" title=""&gt;attracting a record crowd in Gloucester&lt;/a&gt; last week for the win against Wales, plus a likely even better one against Ireland next Sunday in Leicester as the Six Nations resumes, is neat evidence of women’s rugby’s impressive ascent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy becoming the latest Test nation to announce contracts for their players in recent days adds weight to the argument that 2022 has been the most transformational year for the women’s game.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/17/england-france-lead-way-women-rugby-let-down-black-ferns"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Steve Borthwick lifts Leicester to quarter-final showdown with Leinster</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/16/leicester-clermont-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last-16 2nd leg: Leicester 27-17 Clermont; aggregate 56-27&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tigers step on gas after the break to sink Clermont&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the opening whistle to the last, Leicester’s home supporters lapped up the spectacle. Sure it was scrappy, sure both teams coughed up several opportunities, and sure, this wasn’t exactly rugby at its most organised. But it was entertaining. And judging by the volume of the crowd, and the number of ‘ooohs’ and ‘aaahs’ they emitted, they were enjoying themselves under blue east Midlands skies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that they differed with Leicester’s coach Steve Borthwick who, as Ellis Genge revealed, gave his team a “bollocking”. This was the antithesis of Borthwick-ball which is characterised by a ruthlessness in the red zone, discipline at set-piece and an efficiency at the breakdown. To give them their dues, they were commanding in defence as white waves routinely crashed on green and red rocks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/16/leicester-clermont-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Damian de Allende gives mighty Munster the edge over Exeter</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/16/munster-exeter-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last-16 2nd leg: Munster 26-10 Exeter; aggregate 34-23&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joey Carbery scores 21 points for Munster&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps these two-legged knockout ties will catch on. The suspense of a tight, relentlessly physical contest was prolonged until Damian de Allende’s try, eight minutes from time, that proved the knockout blow. Munster emerged battered but victorious from a high-class collision between unstoppable force and immovable object, with a last-eight match against Toulouse looming into view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joey Carbery, the Munster and Ireland fly-half, scored 21 of their 26 points but this was fundamentally a defensive masterclass by Munster and one that evoked memories of the good old days when they won this competition twice in three seasons between 2006 and 2008. It was, in particular, a mammoth individual display by Peter O’Mahony in the back row, the captain refusing to allow Exeter time to settle at the breakdown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/16/munster-exeter-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Agony for Harlequins as Smith misses costly late kick against Montpellier</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/16/harlequins-montpellier-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last-16 2nd leg: Harlequins 33-20 Montpellier; aggregate 59-60&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dramatic finish puts French side through by one point&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Marcus Smith lined up the 77th‑minute conversion that would almost certainly have lifted Harlequins into the quarter-finals there was no one watching, including Montpellier’s director of rugby Philippe Saint-André, who imagined he would miss. Smith had barely put a foot wrong, there was scarcely a hint of wind in the sun-drenched stadium and the kick was nicely angled for a right-footed kicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alas poor Smith, previously outstanding in almost every respect. The ball was close enough to the left upright for sections of the home crowd to raise their arms aloft but the flags stayed down and that was that. A thrilling, see-sawing contest had pretty much everything but from Quins’s perspective it will be remembered as the one that got away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/16/harlequins-montpellier-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Jono Ross’s late try helps Sale progress past Bristol in Champions Cup thriller</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/late-jono-ross-try-helps-sale-progress-past-bristol-in-epic-encounter</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last-16 second leg: Bristol 29-35 Sale&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sharks into quarter-finals after 44-39 aggregate triumph&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sale hit hard, hit often, and occasionally hit high. Their reward, having soaked up the self-inflicted damage caused by one red card and two yellows, is progress to the last eight of the Champions Cup. This last-16 second leg was as chaotic, eventful and entertaining as last week’s first leg had been dire. Ultimately Sale’s physicality, forward muscle and a late try by the captain, Jono Ross, was enough to deny Bristol a first visit to the quarter-finals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a night peppered with high tackles and TMO checks, not to mention a few tries, Sale had Arron Reed sent off in the first half, with Faf de Klerk and Nick Schonert also sent to the sin-bin either side of half-time, but the Sharks were the side still standing at the end of it all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/late-jono-ross-try-helps-sale-progress-past-bristol-in-epic-encounter"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Leicester and Ford’s focus on basics leaves Clermont seeking miracle</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/george-ford-leicester-clermont-champions-cup-rugby-union</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fly-half says there is ‘no secret formula’ to Leicester’s revival as French side pledge to give it their all to overturn deficit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us be honest, the Champions Cup tie between Leicester and Clermont is in effect over. The Premiership leaders produced one of the more &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/clermont-leicester-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report" title=""&gt;remarkable away performances&lt;/a&gt; in European rugby last week, thrashing the Top 14 side 29-10, scoring five tries to one and maintaining their supremacy despite playing with 14 men for the final 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on those events in the Auvergne, something spectacular and calamitous in equal measure would need to transpire at Welford Road on Saturday to prevent Leicester’s march into the next round. That is exactly what Clermont are banking on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/george-ford-leicester-clermont-champions-cup-rugby-union"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>New Harlequins documentary could be a gamechanger for club rugby</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/new-harlequins-documentary-could-be-a-game-changer-for-club-rugby</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prep To Win, created by Bath and England prop Beno Obano, offers a behind-the-scenes look at the Premiership champions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years rugby clubs barely considered their wider profile. As long as their captive audience of season ticket holders and local sponsors were happy, everything else was a bonus. Even for prestigious London sides like Harlequins it was less about the scattering of customers at their games than ensuring there was enough ice and lemon for the committee’s gins and tonics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we forget the huge difference professionalism has made. These days a packed house will be in full cry at the Stoop for the European last-16 second leg fixture against Montpellier, hoping to see last Sunday’s 14-point deficit thrillingly overturned. After last season’s Premiership final, when Quins were memorably crowned domestic champions, there should hopefully be a sizeable lunchtime TV audience on Channel 4 as well on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/new-harlequins-documentary-could-be-a-game-changer-for-club-rugby"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>In New Zealand rugby, women are still viewed as tourists to the game, a footnote to the men | Alice Soper</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2022/apr/15/in-new-zealand-rugby-women-are-still-viewed-as-tourists-to-the-game-a-footnote-to-the-men</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lessons learned from the professionalisation of the men’s game seemingly do not apply to women – it’s still not for us&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the worst thing you can do is win. Success, in a nominal sense, can hide a multitude of sins. While the wins kept coming for New Zealand’s Black Ferns, it was easy to believe that the system was working. Those hasty domestic seasons, shoulder-tapped coaching teams and part-time wages were the winning recipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/black-ferns-report-favouritism-body-shaming-and-cultural-insensitivity-in-scathing-review"&gt;a 34-page review&lt;/a&gt; into the team’s culture and environment has laid bare the true cost of this success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alice Soper found rugby at the age of 13 and has since played at both Eden Park and Twickenham. She is a member of the Strategic Advisory Group for Women in Rugby Aotearoa, a local high school coach and is a regular commentator on issues facing women in sport.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2022/apr/15/in-new-zealand-rugby-women-are-still-viewed-as-tourists-to-the-game-a-footnote-to-the-men"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Guy Porter’s three-week ban highlights uncertainty over ‘foul play’ in rugby</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/14/guy-porter-three-week-ban-highlights-uncertainty-over-foul-play</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leicester centre banned for off-the-ball collision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brive’s Muller gets five-week ban for head-high tackle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty across Europe about the precise definition of “foul play” in rugby union shows no sign of easing after the decision to give Leicester’s Guy Porter a three-week ban for an off-the-ball collision with Clermont’s Fritz Lee in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/clermont-leicester-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report"&gt;Sunday’s Champions Cup last-16 tie&lt;/a&gt;. The original red card has been upheld and Porter will now miss Saturday’s second leg at Welford Road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leicester and Porter contested the charge but an independent disciplinary panel, chaired by Wales’s Roger Morris, found the Tigers centre “had committed a reckless act of foul play” even though neither player had the ball and the head clash looked accidental. The offence was deemed to be in the mid-range category of World Rugby sanctions but Porter’s suspension was halved because of his previously clear disciplinary record.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/14/guy-porter-three-week-ban-highlights-uncertainty-over-foul-play"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
