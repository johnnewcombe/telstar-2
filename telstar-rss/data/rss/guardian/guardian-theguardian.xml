      <title>Joe Rainey: Niineta review | Ammar Kalia's global album of the month</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/joe-rainey-niineta-review-pushing-powwow-music-into-new-spaces</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(37d03d)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;On his debut album, the powwow singer transports Indigenous music to the concert hall and club while losing none of its power&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drum is central to &lt;a href="https://www.nanticokeindians.org/page/what-powwow"&gt;powwow music&lt;/a&gt;. Singers beat in unison on its skin as their voices overlap with vibrato-laden syllabic sounds. No specific language is sung; instead powwow music is a spiritual communication that has anchored Indigenous American inter-tribal gatherings for over a century. On his debut album, Niineta, powwow singer &lt;a href="https://joe-rainey.bandcamp.com/"&gt;Joe Rainey&lt;/a&gt; does without the drum circle and instead foregrounds layers of his own voice, assisted by producer Andrew Broder: the pair met at Bon Iver’s &lt;a href="https://eauxclaires.com/"&gt;Eaux Claires music festival&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently became a part of his 37d03d collective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting 10 tracks provide a glimpse into the powwow lineage while pushing it into new settings and spaces. Many tracks add strings and grandeur to Rainey’s yearning, multi-octave range, transporting his performance to the realm of the concert hall. On BE Son, synth strings pad beneath his baritone to create a forlorn sense of longing, while Turned Engine sees long, bowing phrases add a romantic underpinning to Rainey’s tenor duet with singer Allie Bearhead. The intimate ballad Ch 1222 pairs sparse piano chords with Rainey’s whispering register.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/joe-rainey-niineta-review-pushing-powwow-music-into-new-spaces"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Claire Rousay: Everything Perfect Is Already Here review – everyday sounds that tug at the heartstrings</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/claire-rousay-everything-perfect-is-already-here-review-everyday-sounds-that-tug-at-the-heartstrings</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Shelter Press)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The San Antonio-based artist uses field recordings of lighters and typewriters, voice fragments and classical instrumentation to evoke emotion and memory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “emo ambient” tag seems to have stuck for the music of emergent San Antonio artist &lt;a href="https://clairerousay.com/"&gt;Claire Rousay&lt;/a&gt;, and in all fairness, it fits pretty well. Her work, at its core, is an experiment in using commonplace environmental sounds to tug at the heartstrings directly. Across her quickly growing discography, field recordings of lighters, typewriters and other domestic paraphernalia seamlessly mingle with voice recordings, text-to-speech and the hesitant harmonics of classical instrumentation and drone. Under her direction, these components seem to coalesce into something more than a mere meeting of acoustics and textures, evoking emotion, memory and a striking sense of vulnerability in the listening experience. This is music for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/nov/28/pauline-oliveros-deep-listening-dead-obituary"&gt;Oliveros&lt;/a&gt;-inspired deep listeners and for poets finding meaning among the mundane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On her latest record, Everything Perfect Is Already Here, Rousay welcomes melodic elements into her compositions: on It Feels Foolish to Care, wandering harp progressions join slumbering violins, voices and laughter, and possibly paper rustles and poured liquids; a piano refrain drops in towards the end without buildup, tender yet sudden enough to hit like a stunner out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/claire-rousay-everything-perfect-is-already-here-review-everyday-sounds-that-tug-at-the-heartstrings"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘It’s just good energy!’ How TikTok and Covid made drum’n’bass hot again</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/its-just-good-energy-how-tiktok-and-covid-made-drumnbass-hot-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 90s genre is being freshened up by young, often female artists mixing hyper-fast breakbeats with soft vocals. But why is it so suited to our post-lockdown, attention-deficient era?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lincoln Barrett started making drum’n’bass tracks in the late 90s, he says, “people were kind of mocking me for being into it. People were already saying drum’n’bass is dead. Going into the record shop in Cardiff, Catapult, you would kind of get the piss taken out of you by people who were, I guess, into trance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He laughs. In the intervening period, Barrett became High Contrast, one of the most respected drum’n’bass producers in the world: he’s about to celebrate the 20th anniversary of his debut album, True Colours. Drum’n’bass, meanwhile, has steadfastly refused to die – in fact, it is enjoying an unexpected moment in the sun, freshening up 2022’s pop music. “It’s people who aren’t really part of the drum’n’bass scene just coming through and doing jungle in their own way, and it’s really in a separate lane from established artists and what drum’n’bass is now,” says Barrett. “It’s amazing that it’s been led mainly by young women artists as well.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/its-just-good-energy-how-tiktok-and-covid-made-drumnbass-hot-again"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Norse code: are white supremacists reading too much into The Northman?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/22/norse-code-white-supremacists-reading-the-northman-robert-eggers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Robert Eggers’ Viking blockbuster has already been hailed by white nationalists keen to exploit European mythology. Can Hollywood tell historical tales without unwittingly appealing to toxic ideologies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the London premiere of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/11/the-northman-review-robert-eggers-hamlet-outrageous-violence" title=""&gt;The Northman&lt;/a&gt; in early April, the director, Robert Eggers, explained on stage how he was seeking to reclaim Viking history from rightwing groups. Many of these groups thrive on myths of an imagined European past: a time before racial mixing or progressive politics, when men were mighty warriors and women were compliant child-bearers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Eggers &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/10/the-northman-director-robert-eggers-interview" title=""&gt;told the Observer&lt;/a&gt; recently, such associations almost put him off making The Northman. “The macho stereotype of that history, along with, you know, the rightwing misappropriation of Viking culture, made me sort of allergic to it, and I just never wanted to go there.” Eggers has spoken of his scholarly research and commitment to getting Viking history right, down to the smallest details. But as rigorous and accomplished as The Northman is, it might in fact be the kind of movie the “alt-right” loves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/22/norse-code-white-supremacists-reading-the-northman-robert-eggers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Chivalry review – Steve Coogan and Sarah Solemani’s immensely satisfying #MeToo comedy</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/21/chivalry-review-steve-coogan-and-sarah-solemani-immensely-satisfying-metoo-comedy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What if Alan Partridge were a Hollywood hotshot in 2022? This razor-sharp show follows an old-school film producer floundering in a strange new world – and it’s got just the right amount of wrongness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an undoubted sense in which new Channel 4 series &lt;a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/chivalry"&gt;Chivalry&lt;/a&gt;, co-written by and co-starring Steve Coogan and Sarah Solemani, asks the question, “What if Alan Partridge were a successful Hollywood producer in the post-#MeToo era?” This is a question worth asking, especially when the answers are as good and funny and deft as they are here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coogan plays Cameron, a fairly (one imagines) typical film producer. He’s just coming out of another relationship with a twentysomething partner who was his assistant. He has slept with the leading lady he is now trying to persuade to reshoot scenes from his latest project. And he is just bright enough to know he’s being left behind as this strange, new landscape emerges, but not bright enough to know how to adapt to it. When Bobby (Solemani), the indie darling who has been brought in to detoxify the project poisoned by its European old-guard director, shouts “Sorry!” as she rushes off mid-conversation, because a call about her son comes through, he shouts back: “Never apologise for being a mother!” It’s the perfect amount of wrongness that Partridge made his own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/21/chivalry-review-steve-coogan-and-sarah-solemani-immensely-satisfying-metoo-comedy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rap the casbah: the Casablanca school giving young hip-hop stars a voice</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/21/rap-the-casbah-the-casablanca-school-giving-young-hip-hop-stars-a-voice</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nabil Ayouch’s film Casablanca Beats offers a glimpse of how Moroccan teens are finding an outlet in hip-hop. The director reveals how its positive energy has given him hope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Hip-hop didn’t just come out of nowhere,” explains young teacher Anas to his even younger class in Casablanca Beats. He speaks of the “poverty, racism and humiliation” experienced by hip-hop’s African-American founders, and how the genre became a vehicle for self-empowerment and social change. “It’s rap that speaks of our lives, of our problems, things people aren’t supposed to know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Moroccan teenagers listening to Anas can relate to this. Hip-hop is now a commercial industry in the US, but around the world rap has become the lingua franca for disempowered and disaffected youth, and the soundtrack to revolution. Nowhere more so than north Africa. During the Arab spring in the 2010s, protesters in Tunisia and Egypt chanted the lyrics of Tunisian rapper El Général’s anti-corruption anthem Rais Lebled: “Misery is everywhere and the people haven’t found a place to sleep / I am speaking in name of the people who are suffering and crushed beneath the feet.” In Algeria, too, the recent Hirak movement has been backed by anti-government rap tunes such as Raja Meziane’s Allo le Système!. Even in relatively stable Morocco, there are still plenty of problems for young people to talk about, and plenty of people who don’t want them to talk, or sing, let alone dance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/21/rap-the-casbah-the-casablanca-school-giving-young-hip-hop-stars-a-voice"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Schoeck: Elegie review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/21/othmar-schoeck-elegie-review-christian-gerhaher</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christian Gerhaher/Basel Chamber Orchestra/Heinz Holliger&lt;br&gt;(Sony Classical)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;A rarely heard 24-song cycle with ensemble represents one of the last great flowerings of the romantic lieder tradition&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Othmar Schoeck’s song cycles, some with piano, others with instrumental ensemble or full orchestra, represent one of the last great flowerings of the romantic lieder tradition. Outside his native Switzerland at least, his music is heard far less often than it deserves to be, but the baritone &lt;a href="https://www.gerhaher.de/index.php/en/"&gt;Christian Gerhaher&lt;/a&gt; at least seems determined to promote its cause; in 2009 he released a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/oct/15/schoeck-notturno-album-review"&gt;recording of Schoeck’s Notturno for voice and string quartet&lt;/a&gt;, and now he has turned his attention to Elegie, a collection of settings of poems by Eichendorff and Lenau, which was completed in 1922.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first of &lt;a href="https://schoeckfestival.ch/schoeck/biography/"&gt;Schoeck&lt;/a&gt;’s song cycles with ensemble, using a group of 15 instruments that includes piano, timpani and a tam-tam, from which he extracts some striking textures and colours. Though at this time Schoeck’s music was still rooted in the late Romanticism of Brahms and his teacher Reger, it clearly shows his awareness of the expressionism of the &lt;a href="https://www.classicfm.com/discover-music/periods-genres/modern/second-viennese-school-where-start/"&gt;Second Viennese School&lt;/a&gt; – with occasional echoes even of Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire – though it was only in his later works that he would explore around the fringes of that musical world more consistently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/21/othmar-schoeck-elegie-review-christian-gerhaher"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Annie Lennox’s 30 greatest songs – ranked!</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/21/annie-lennox-30-greatest-songs-ranked</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the Scottish pop icon’s debut solo album Diva turns 30, we run down through her best work with the Tourists and Eurythmics and as a solo artist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the marquee-name covers on Medusa – Bob Marley, Al Green, Procul Harum – lurks this gorgeous take on the Blue Nile’s masterpiece of careworn romance. You could argue the source material is so good you can’t go wrong, but Lennox really inhabits the lyric: its emotional climax – “I’m tired of crying on the stairs!” – is suitably gut-punching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/21/annie-lennox-30-greatest-songs-ranked"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Fontaines DC: Skinty Fia review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/21/fontaines-dc-skinty-fia-review-boldly-embracing-a-state-of-confusion</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On their third album, the Dublin alt-rockers trade in their punky full-pelt approach for measured, compelling insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fontaines DC have been a lot of different things over the course of their brief career. Gobby upstarts, loudly proclaiming their own greatness – “my childhood was small, but I’m gonna be big,” crowed Grian Chatten on the opening track of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/12/fontaines-dc-dogrel-album-review-irish-punks-debut"&gt;the band’s 2019 debut&lt;/a&gt; – and surly self-doubters, prickly distrustful of their own success and acclaim: “Pigeonholed, coo’ed to death,” complained Chatten on its 2020 successor &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/30/fontaines-dc-a-heros-death-review"&gt;A Hero’s Death&lt;/a&gt;. The sound of young Dublin, decrying the limitations of their home city – “if you’re a rock star, pornstar, superstar – doesn’t matter what you are / get a good car, get out of here” – and Irish emigres uneasily relocated to Britain: “London’s fine, did my time / threshed the truth out the lie.” A band who felt like a reset button on an increasingly moribund alt-rock scene, barging to the head of a fresh wave of artists with noisy guitars and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/31/all-talk-why-2019s-best-bands-speak-instead-of-sing"&gt;sprechgesang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/31/all-talk-why-2019s-best-bands-speak-instead-of-sing"&gt; vocals&lt;/a&gt;, and refuseniks, declining to be part of anything: “I don’t belong to anyone, I don’t want to belong to anyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given their history, the question of what Fontaines DC are now lurks around their third album. It comes wrapped in a sleeve featuring a nervous-looking deer in the hallway of a home, its title derives from a Gaelic expression of exasperation, and it variously picks at topics of addiction, relationships and the notion of Irishness as viewed through the lens of the Irish diaspora. If its predecessor was an album audibly written by a tour-weary band wary of the hyperventilating reviews and Mercury prize nominations – home to songs with names such as Televised Mind, A Lucid Dream and No – its great skill lay in turning said wariness into songs that felt gripping and realistic, not petulant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/21/fontaines-dc-skinty-fia-review-boldly-embracing-a-state-of-confusion"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Mind that satellite! The mission to clean up dangerous space junk</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/21/mind-satellite-mission-clean-up-dangerous-space-junk-astronauts-debris</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As soon as we left the planet, we began leaving rubbish in orbit. Now it is putting space stations and astronauts at risk. What can be done about the millions of pieces of debris?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November last year, the five astronauts and two cosmonauts on the International Space Station (ISS) were ordered to suit up and take refuge in their capsules for fear their spaceship might be struck by flying debris. Russia had deliberately &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/nov/16/russia-defends-anti-satellite-missile-test"&gt;destroyed one of its own satellites with a missile&lt;/a&gt;, producing a cloud of wreckage that threatened the orbiting outpost. “It’s a crazy way to start a mission,” Nasa told its sheltering crew, who had arrived only days beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident revealed how hairy Earth’s orbit has become, and it wasn’t a one-off. Two weeks later, mission controllers received another alert that the ISS might be hit by more debris. This time, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/nov/30/astronauts-face-higher-debris-risk-in-spacewalk-to-replace-iss-antenna"&gt;Nasa delayed a planned spacewalk&lt;/a&gt; amid concerns that the astronauts could be in danger if they went outside. Before the week was out, yet another warning came in, this one forcing the space station to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/03/international-space-station-forced-to-swerve-to-avoid-us-space-junk#:~:text=International%20Space%20Station%20forced%20to%20swerve%20to%20avoid%20US%20space%20junk,-This%20article%20is&amp;amp;text=The%20International%20Space%20Station%20performed,Russia%27s%20space%20agency%20has%20said."&gt;dodge a US rocket body&lt;/a&gt; that has been barrelling around Earth since the 90s. It was all worryingly reminiscent of the 2013 movie &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/07/gravity-review"&gt;Gravity&lt;/a&gt;, in which debris from a shot-down satellite damages not just the ISS but the Hubble space telescope and a visiting space shuttle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/21/mind-satellite-mission-clean-up-dangerous-space-junk-astronauts-debris"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent review – Nicolas Cage is Nicolas Cage</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/21/the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent-review-nicolas-cage</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Playing himself, Cage serves the acting fans love him for – but has this strained action comedy spoiled the joke?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;N&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/nicolascage"&gt;icolas Cage&lt;/a&gt; has officially revealed he’s in on the joke … if “joke” is precisely what it is. But has that spoiled the joke – if that is the correct word? This is a self-aware action comedy whose title is possibly the funniest bit, riffing on Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being as well as possibly Dave Eggers’s memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. Producer-star Cage plays “Nick Cage”: Hollywood ledge and national treasure (to quote a relevant movie title) now in a midlife crisis, haunted by CGI-doppelganger visions of his angry younger self, no longer booking the big roles and facing a grim future in which, as his agent (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/neil-patrick-harris"&gt;Neil Patrick Harris&lt;/a&gt;) puts it, he plays the cool gay uncle in a Duplass brothers film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cage is living in a hotel, estranged from his wife Olivia (a thanklessly unfunny role for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sharon-horgan"&gt;Sharon Horgan&lt;/a&gt;) and moody teen daughter Addy (Lily Mo Sheen), who hates the movie classics he tries introducing her to. (I was waiting for Addy to declare herself instead a massive fan of movies by the Coppola family. Maybe that would be an in-joke too far.) Cash-strapped Cage is forced to accept a million-dollar appearance fee at the spectacular luxury home of a billionaire plutocrat Javi Gutierrez (Pedro Pascal) who is a besotted superfan. But then the CIA gets word to our hero that Javi is a dangerous cartel gangster and Cage must use his privileged access to bring him down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/21/the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent-review-nicolas-cage"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>I have a urinal in my flat and it has changed my life – so why are people appalled? | Adrian Chiles</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/21/urinal-in-my-flat-changed-my-life-so-why-are-people-appalled</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some have been known to retch at the sight of it, but I am a great enthusiast for urinals in the home. Mine has pride of place beneath the West Brom crest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those Hollywood fellows Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney are never far from social media virality. Last week they were at it again. For reasons that remain unclear, the pair of them have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/feb/09/ryan-reynolds-and-rob-mcelhenney-complete-takeover-of-wrexham"&gt;bought Wrexham AFC&lt;/a&gt;, in the fifth tier of English football, and pumped some money into the place. Now Reynolds has made McElhenney a birthday present of a urinal at the club’s stadium, placing a commemorative plaque next to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This put me in mind of a friend of mine, the late and much-missed Jon Brookes, drummer with the Charlatans. When West Brom demolished their home fans’ end of the stadium, he nicked some bricks from it for an extension that his brother, another West Brom fan, was getting built. It was only on the way home with the bricks, in his brother’s Capri, that they realised the bricks were from the toilet block. The stench was awful. But, like the true fans they were, they used them anyway and after a few months the smell abated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/21/urinal-in-my-flat-changed-my-life-so-why-are-people-appalled"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Playground review – kid’s-eye-view nightmare of schoolyard bullying</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/21/playground-review-kids-eye-view-nightmare-of-schoolyard-bullying</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maya Vanderbeque makes an amazing debut as seven-year-old Nora, who tells on the boys bullying her brother with nightmarish consequences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laura Wandel’s debut feature was Belgium’s official submission for the Oscars: a kid’s-eye-view nightmare of playground bullying impossible to watch without a sick, jittery feeling of rage and dread. The original French title is “Un Monde” – “A World” – and the playground is a universe of fear which we all edit out of our adult memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rather amazing seven-year-old newcomer called Maya Vanderbeque stars as Nora, seen mostly in extreme, searching closeup. Just the opening shot of her crying face supplies pretty much enough emotional charge to power the whole film. Nora is just starting school, and her sobbing mini-drama-queen distress at the school gates discomforts her dad (Karim Leklou) and especially her older brother Abel (Günter Duret), a wannabe tough guy who doesn’t want his clingy kid sister embarrassing him in the playground. When she witnesses him being bullied by the other boys – with whom Abel had hoped to bully someone else – she tells the teachers and her dad, thus humiliating him and breaking a whole unwritten statute book about not snitching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/21/playground-review-kids-eye-view-nightmare-of-schoolyard-bullying"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘It’s the worst thing I ever put in my mouth!’ : my week living off TikTok recipes</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/21/its-the-worst-thing-i-ever-put-in-my-mouth-my-week-living-off-tiktok-recipes</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Custard toast, smashed brussels sprouts and a Snickers in a gherkin. Is it time to ditch the cook books and get your recipes from social media? There’s only one way to find out ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone over the age of 25, TikTok is a baffling world of moronic dance routines and teenagers lip-syncing to each other’s conversations. Yet it’s also a hotbed of authentic culinary creativity. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/29/quarantine-cookings-seven-biggest-trends-power-ranked-by-adam-liaw"&gt;Dalgona coffee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/tiktok-cloud-bread"&gt;cloud bread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/uk/cooking/recipes/a35426947/baked-feta-pasta-tiktok/"&gt;feta pasta,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/uk/food-news/a36798869/how-to-wrap-a-tortilla/"&gt;the tortilla folding hack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/uk/food-news/a35161088/tiktok-massive-hot-cocoa-bomb/"&gt;hot chocolate bombs&lt;/a&gt; – these crossover food trends all gained popularity on the platform, and they are only the tip of the iceberg lettuce. But what makes certain dishes go viral, and are any of them any good? Will social media replace recipe books? In a transparent, ultimately pathetic attempt to stay relevant, I’ll be living largely off TikTok recipes for one week to find out, and keeping a food diary. Let’s go!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/21/its-the-worst-thing-i-ever-put-in-my-mouth-my-week-living-off-tiktok-recipes"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The film Putin doesn’t want the world to see: Firebird, a gay love story about fighter pilots</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/21/film-putin-firebird-gay-love-story-fighter-pilots-dogfights-desire-moscow-russian</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been accused of ‘shaming Moscow’ and ‘punching the Russian soldier in the face’. But the makers of this powerful drama about dogfights and dangerous desires refuse to be silenced&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oleg Zagorodnii is sitting in the cafe he owns in Kyiv, beneath a brightly coloured painting of Aladdin smiling down from the wall behind. “It is just me now, no baristas,” says the Ukrainian actor via video call. “People come. I make them coffee, give them dessert. They are happy to feel some kind of normal life. They sit in the cafe, we play music, we speak. Of course, all we talk about is war.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zagorodnii has twice attempted to enlist in the army, only to be told that there are currently more volunteers than equipment. The best he can do is make appeals on social media for bulletproof vests, and use the cafe as a place to pass on food, supplies and military uniforms. “I try to do what I can in this terrible time,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/21/film-putin-firebird-gay-love-story-fighter-pilots-dogfights-desire-moscow-russian"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Asian country, there are three different ways of calculating your age – one of which means a newborn baby can be two years old. Now the president-elect is pushing for change &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; The Korean Age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age:&lt;/strong&gt; Korean.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/everyone-in-south-korea-could-soon-be-getting-younger"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A joyous Syrian refugee graduates high school – Marlena Waldthausen’s best photograph</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;‘These three women fled to Germany from Syria. This is Malak’s joyful graduation day, which is being livestreamed to her family back home’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, one million Syrians arrived in Germany in search of safety. Five years later, I was on a newspaper assignment in Nuremberg, a city to the south of country, documenting the integration of these refugees into German society. This was one of the examples where everything had worked out brilliantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the right is Malak. When she arrived in Germany, she didn’t know a word of the language. It was really hard but she worked like hell to learn and build a new life. Five years later, she had managed to put herself right through secondary school. This is from her graduation day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/20/syrian-refugee-high-school-graduates-malak-germany-marlena-waldthausen-best-photograph-"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a trip to the Isle of Man, I marvelled once again at the joy of being aboard a boat, which I’d take over flying or the Channel tunnel any time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love ferries. Give me a ferry over a flight any day of the week, and I’d rather take a ferry than the Channel tunnel every time. All that burrowing along under the sea with no sea to look at: what’s that all about? I need the thrill of the land fading astern and new land coming to the fore. Down below, in the tunnel, it’s rubbish – nothing to look at apart from your watch telling you when the 35-minute crossing is over. Crossing? Even the word sounds wrong for something that goes under the sea rather than over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, ferries are my thing. They’re never scrupulously clean or particularly tidy; they’re too functional for that. And I’ve never been on a ferry that didn’t look as if it had seen better days. But they present themselves as rather pleasingly worn in, rather than worn out. And best of all, they’re never fancy. I’m against fanciness in all things. I know there have been attempts to fancify ferries, or parts of them, with business-class areas and whatnot, but to no avail. They’re never going to feel very exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/20/grime-chips-tea-fresh-air-nowt-fancy-ferries-love-isle-of-man"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
