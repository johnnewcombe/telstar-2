      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pep Guardiola and Michael Phelps will also play in New Jersey&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Australian retired from tennis this month at age of 25&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ash Barty will return to the world stage of sport wielding a golf club rather than a tennis racket. The former world No 1 will play in a teams exhibition event in New Jersey from 30 June 30 to 1 July, alongside some of sport’s biggest names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barty, who announced her shock retirement last month aged just 25, will be a headline act in the Icons Series which will be played in the US for the first time.

      <title>Shark: did the golfing gods really single out Greg Norman for misery?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/18/greg-norman-golf-documentary-espn-masters-1996</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new ESPN documentary reassesses the career of the Australian, with particular  attention paid to his famous meltdown at the 1996 Masters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years it’s become fashionable for sport documentaries to include a self-referential element in which the protagonist reviews footage of their own triumphs and disasters. The facial reactions in these segments often say more than hours of talking head analysis ever could: the vision of Michael Jordan, tablet in lap, choking up with laughter as Gary Payton’s account of the 1996 NBA finals series is played back to him remains the defining image of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/23/the-last-dance-spectacular-michael-jordan-netflix"&gt;2020’s The Last Dance&lt;/a&gt;. For Shark, premiering in the US on Tuesday night, directors Jason Hehir (who also directed The Last Dance) and Thomas Odelfelt replace the tablet with a laptop kept open on a small side table next to the seated Greg Norman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Australian has never rewatched &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/07/my-favourite-game-nick-faldo-greg-norman-1996-masters"&gt;the infamous final round of the 1996 Masters&lt;/a&gt;, in which he relinquished a six-shot lead to surrender the green jacket to arch-rival Nick Faldo: “There’s no need to,” he says curtly in the opening minutes of Shark. And when the footage of that fabled choke – still the biggest final-day lead ever blown in a PGA tour tournament – starts rolling on the laptop, you soon begin to understand why. The pain of every slice, hook, undercooked putt and moment of self-doubt is still very much with him, 25 years later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/18/greg-norman-golf-documentary-espn-masters-1996"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rory McIlroy’s magical Masters finish offers reminder of his star quality | Ewan Murray</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/11/rory-mcilroys-magical-masters-finish-offers-reminder-of-his-star-quality</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;McIlroy’s best performance at Augusta should give him the belief to contend at the remaining majors this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rory McIlroy has been dejected enough times when exiting on to Washington Road via Magnolia Lane that he is entitled to savour a sense of harmony after leaving Augusta National this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the latest staging of the Masters &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/11/golf-masters-scottie-scheffler-wins-rory-mcilroy-second-report" title=""&gt;ultimately belonged to Scottie Scheffler&lt;/a&gt;, it was a tournament dominated by other themes. Fascination regarding Tiger Woods’s every move was clear by the depth of galleries and television ratings. And when those around the 18th green roared for McIlroy’s hole out from a bunker, it was the loudest celebration of day four. That Scheffler four-putted his final hole played a part in that scenario but we had already been served a reminder of the fervour with which people want McIlroy to regain his major-winning touch. McIlroy’s own display of emotion resonated; he had given himself a chance to win the Green Jacket as his bunker shot rolled in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/11/rory-mcilroys-magical-masters-finish-offers-reminder-of-his-star-quality"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Masters 2022: Scheffler wins first major as McIlroy surges to second – as it happened</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/apr/10/the-masters-2022-final-round-live</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scottie Scheffler held his nerve to win by three&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rory McIlroy claimed second with sensational 64&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cameron Smith’s hopes were sunk at 12&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.masters.com/en_US/scores/index.html"&gt;Official Masters leader board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A perfect start for Rory McIlroy. &lt;/strong&gt;He cracks his opening drive down the middle, then wedges to ten feet. He rolls confidently into the cup, and the birdie brings him back to level par in short order. Rory isn’t out of this, but he’ll need to shoot something in the mid to low 60s and hope Scottie Scheffler, Cam Smith and Im Sung-jae have off days to varying degrees. Meanwhile Min Woo Lee keeps on keepin’ on: from the centre of 7, he spins a glorious approach to six feet and makes a second birdie in a row. He’s level par, and looks a real prospect. He’s already got the Scottish Open on his CV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minjee Lee finally won her maiden major last year at the Evian, after a couple of close shaves at the Dinah Shore and the British Open. &lt;/strong&gt;Her little brother Min Woo isn’t half bad at golf either. The 23-year-old Aussie has hit what could already be the shot of the day, coming four feet shy of replicating Louis Oosthuizen’s 2012 albatross at 2. Lee tidied up for his eagle, and he’s since made birdie at 6. He’s whisked up the leader board to +1 as a result. A pretty impressive performance on debut, this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/apr/10/the-masters-2022-final-round-live"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Scottie Scheffler holds nerve to win Masters after Rory McIlroy’s late surge</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/11/golf-masters-scottie-scheffler-wins-rory-mcilroy-second-report</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;World No 1 Scheffler claims his first major by three shots&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;McIlroy posts final round of 64 to finish in second place&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rory McIlroy’s wild celebrations were of a man who had just completed a career grand slam. Instead, Scottie Scheffler withstood one of the finest rounds in Augusta National’s fabled history to etch his name into folklore as a world No 1 who has won the Masters. Scheffler stood on the 18th tee with a five-shot lead in the 86th staging of this event. The stuff of dreams. A subsequent double bogey – which included a bizarre four-putt – mattered not a jot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McIlroy’s race had looked run as he played from bunker to bunker on the tournament’s 72nd hole. Instead, the Northern Irishman holed out from the sand. The subsequent delirium of McIlroy and the galleries will linger as a moment for the ages. His 64 matched the lowest final round ever recorded in the Masters. His second place represents a career high in this major. Yet this was Scheffler’s day; just as it has been Scheffler’s year. What he may lack in personality he makes up for with iron accuracy that defies what pressure should do to even professional golfers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/11/golf-masters-scottie-scheffler-wins-rory-mcilroy-second-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Tiger Woods savours magical Masters comeback and sets sights on Open</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/10/tiger-woods-delighted-with-his-masters-despite-back-to-back-78s</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Woods ranks playing four rounds at Augusta as one of his greatest achievements and confirmed he will be at St Andrews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The look on Tiger Woods’s face as he walked off the 18th green told you all you need to know about what he’s been through in the last 14 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods had just shot his second consecutive round of 78, which is the worst score he’s ever made in the 24 years he’s been playing here, and done it on a day that seemed tailor-made for going low. The round left him 13 over par for the tournament, and 22 shots off Scottie Scheffler’s lead, in 47th place. And despite it all, he was grinning like he’d just won the tournament. He clearly wasn’t exaggerating when he said he wasn’t sure whether his injuries would ever allow him to play competitive golf again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/10/tiger-woods-delighted-with-his-masters-despite-back-to-back-78s"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Masters 2022: third round – as it happened</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/apr/09/the-masters-2022-third-round-live</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cameron Smith was the main beneficiary of Moving Day as his 68 took him closer to runaway leader Scottie Scheffler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rory rolls another one in! &lt;/strong&gt;He curls a right-to-left 25-footer into the cup for birdie on 7. All good, except it follows a heavy handed chip from the fringe at 6 that left a six-footer he couldn’t make. Two bogeys and two birdies, and he can get no higher than +2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victor Hovland only just made the cut after opening rounds of 72 and 76. &lt;/strong&gt;He needs something really special today - plus a Scottie Scheffler stumble - if he’s to contest tomorrow. That didn’t look on the cards when he went out this morning in 37, but he’s caught alight since turning, with birdies at 10, 11 and now 13. Some way to breeze around Amen Corner. He’s +2.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/apr/09/the-masters-2022-third-round-live"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Scheffler keeps Masters challengers at bay but Smith gives himself a shot</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/masters-frontrunner-scottie-scheffler-faces-challenge-from-cameron-smith</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;World No 1 leads by three after fast start to third round&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Australian Smith hits 68; Tiger Woods struggles to 78&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It felt for so much of day three that Augusta National yearned for something even resembling a contest. It was Scottie Scheffler’s job to ensure one did not ensue. For 17 holes, he was a man in complete control of all around him. What happened next offers hope. There may be a thrilling Masters denouement after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be no sixth Green Jacket for Tiger Woods. Not at this attempt, anyway. Those who flocked to Georgia in search of yet another Woods redemption tale have been left disappointed. Freakishly cold weather and Scheffler’s powerful frontrunning added to an unavoidable sense of deflation. Plenty of polite applause, precious little roaring. Until, that is, Scheffler pulled his drive at the last into bushes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/masters-frontrunner-scottie-scheffler-faces-challenge-from-cameron-smith"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rory McIlroy treads water trying to keep his Masters dream alive | Andy Bull</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/rory-mcilroy-treads-water-trying-to-keep-his-masters-dream-alive</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Northern Irishman still attracts galleries at Augusta but has now adjusted his sights to a top-10 finish going into final day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like I’m right there,” said Rory McIlroy on Friday night, as he weighed his chances after back‑to‑back rounds of 73 on Thursday and Friday. “You go out tomorrow and you play a decent front nine, and all of a sudden you’re right in the thick of things.” Seventeen hours later, he stepped out on to the 1st tee and, thwack, dumped his opening drive right into a fairway bunker, then, crack, whacked his second shot into the lip where it rebounded and fell back down by his feet. His third made it on to the green, where he took two putts from 20ft. So McIlroy started his charge to the top by dropping a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, it was off to long downhill dog-leg 2nd, which has been the easiest hole on the course this week. The field have made more than a hundred birdies there. Just the place to get that run up the leaderboard going, then. This time there was a long, loud cry of “Right!” as McIlroy’s drive whizzed overhead into the gallery, after that he fizzed his second into the front bunker, and scrambled his way out in even par. On to the stiff uphill 3rd then, a trickier proposition this, but McIlroy earned a birdie chance with a brilliant approach that landed 7ft from the pin. Then he missed the putt. Oh, Rory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/rory-mcilroy-treads-water-trying-to-keep-his-masters-dream-alive"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Tiger Woods writes latest redemption tale as Scheffler surges into Masters lead</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/masters-golf-tiger-woods-scottie-scheffler-day-two-report</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Woods overcomes nightmare start to make cut at one over&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;World No 1 Scheffler posts dazzling 67 to take five-shot lead&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this point it would be reasonable to assume Tiger Woods is beyond career firsts. Not so and, in this case, not for the right reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods’s celebrated period at Augusta National had never included the playing of holes 1 to 5 in four over par. Until day two of the Masters’ 86th edition, that is. As Woods toiled badly in the most testing of conditions, Thursday’s fairytale had descended into Friday’s nightmare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/masters-golf-tiger-woods-scottie-scheffler-day-two-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Masters 2022: second round – as it happened</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/apr/08/the-masters-2022-second-round-live</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;World No1 Scottie Scheffler shoots 67 to take a five-stroke lead going into the weekend&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DJ doesn’t hit his birdie putt on 1, but par will always work.&lt;/strong&gt; He remains at -3. Morikawa makes no mistake, though, rolling confidently into the back of the cup for a birdie that takes him to level par for the tournament. Meanwhile up on 3, Im restores his lead by rolling in a 25-footer for birdie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-5: Im (3)&lt;br&gt;-4: Smith&lt;br&gt;-3: D Johnson (1), Willett, Niemann, Scheffler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/apr/08/the-masters-2022-second-round-live"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Patience keeps McIlroy in Masters reckoning with a few dramas on way | Andy Bull</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/08/patience-keeps-mcilroy-in-touch-at-masters-with-a-few-dramas-on-way</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quest for win that would give him career grand slam has taken on many forms and this year’s version is more conservative&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight years Rory McIlroy has been coming here to try to win the major he needs to complete the grand slam, and it feels as if he has gone about it in eight different ways. There was the McIlroy who had discovered meditation, and the McIlroy who fixated on his method, the McIlroy who had been reading self-help books, the McIlroy who was studying the swing science, and the McIlroy who was muscled up because he was spending so much time in the gym; there was McIlroy who talked up how much the Masters meant and the McIlroy who played it down. None of them got it done. So this year he has brought boring Rory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the week McIlroy kept talking about being conservative, disciplined and patient. His plan was to play for the middle of the green, pick off the birdie putts when they came and make sure he stayed away from the kind of trouble that ends up in the big numbers that leave him too much to do come Sunday. Which was not a bad strategy so far as they go. The only trouble with it is, as he said himself, is it is not a style of play that comes naturally to him.McIlroy is a risk-taker, a shot-maker, a heart-breaker: he sees too many possibilities in the game to take it slow and steady. “It goes against my nature.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/08/patience-keeps-mcilroy-in-touch-at-masters-with-a-few-dramas-on-way"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Missed cut leads reflective Sandy Lyle towards talk of Masters farewell</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/08/sandy-lyle-2022-masters-missed-cut-farewell</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Former champion, struggling now with distance, suggests that 2023 could be his last year at Augusta National&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandy Lyle can still remember the first time. The 2023 Masters is likely to be the last time. Lyle created a little piece of history at Augusta National this week, having teed up in a major for the 100th time. He thereby becomes the first golfer from Scotland to achieve that not inconsequential feat. Not that the 64-year-old was aware of his milestone. “Nobody has ever mentioned that to me,” he said. “Does it make me feel better? Yes, a little bit. Something to tell the grandkids in years to come.” Lyle’s mood had been influenced by another missed Masters cut. “It’s not easy when you are making bogey after bogey,” he conceded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1988 champion last survived for the weekend in Georgia in 2014, with his latest halfway exit coming after rounds of 82 and 76. These are not embarrassing scores – Augusta, already a tricky venue, is especially formidable this year – but Lyle’s scenario lends itself to the narrative of when enough becomes enough for invitees. Unlike in other majors, winners of the Masters are entitled to play for as long as they so choose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/08/sandy-lyle-2022-masters-missed-cut-farewell"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Im Sung-jae finished at five under par, one shot clear of Cam Smith and four clear of Tiger Woods on his return to Augusta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migliozzi is joined at the top by the ever-entertaining Harry Higgs.&lt;/strong&gt; The 30-year-old from Dallas is playing in his first Masters, having finished tied for fourth at Kiawah in last year’s PGA, and is very much part of the Barnes-Daly-Jimenez everyman tradition, as anyone who remembers him getting the old puppies out at the Phoenix Open a couple of months ago will attest. Having opened with bogey, he’s seized the day much as he embraces life, with birdies at 2, 3 and now 4. The young Australian Min Woo Lee, current Scottish Open champion, makes it three with a long birdie rake across 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-2: Migliozzi (6), MW Lee (5), Higgs (4)&lt;br&gt;-1: Harrington (8)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2022/apr/07/golf-the-masters-2022-augusta-tiger-woods-live-updates"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Masters: Cameron Smith’s clunky bookends mar superb opening chapter</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/08/the-masters-cameron-smith-first-round-danny-willett-tiger-woods</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Round of 68 started and finished with double bogeys&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Danny Willett opens with 69, Tiger Woods begins with 71&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whiff of abnormality prevailed at Augusta National on Thursday morning. An epic overnight storm – during which thunder cracked over Augusta for hours on end – led to a delay in play getting under way. This venue’s famous azaleas are not in full bloom, the consequence of previous weather issues. Gary Player had already caused red faces among Green Jackets by donning a Saudi Arabian advertising logo for honorary starting duties by the time the South African offered an obscure perspective on the merits of India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love India, the intelligence, the technology, the manners,” Player said. “The women dress so nicely. I’m so used to seeing women with damn dresses up their bum and you don’t see anything like that in India.” Where to begin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/08/the-masters-cameron-smith-first-round-danny-willett-tiger-woods"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
