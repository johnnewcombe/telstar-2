002.003 (2021-10-??)

 * The source distribution now includes a Fontmap file for
   Ghostscript.

002.002 (2020-06-22)
====================

User-visible changes in this release:

 * The 'ss14' feature now works properly.
 * The lack-of-copyright notices in the OTF files are back.
 * Each font now contains either both of names 16 and 17 or neither
   of them.
 * The 'aalt' lookup now occurs first in each font, as it should.
 * Diagonal strokes are 6% thinner in the regular font, making them
   about the same width as vertical and horizontal strokes.  Other
   widths have changed proportionally.
 * The glyph for U+2295 CIRCLED PLUS is now called "circleplus",
   rather than "uni2295".  The old name is retained as an alias.
 * The glyph for U+2126 OHM SIGN is now called "Omega",
   rather than "uni2126".  The old name is retained as an alias.
 * Glyphs for characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane now
   have the correct names ("uXXXXX" instead of "uniXXXXX").  The old
   names have been retained as aliases.
 * The shapes of ten quadrant glyphs have been corrected:
   - U+2596 QUADRANT LOWER LEFT
   - U+2597 QUADRANT LOWER RIGHT
   - U+2598 QUADRANT UPPER LEFT
   - U+2599 QUADRANT UPPER LEFT AND LOWER LEFT AND LOWER RIGHT

002.001 (2020-03-29)
====================

User-visible changes in this release:

 * Characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane are now correctly
   encoded in BDF files.
 * The 'c2sc' feature now produces glyphs that have names indicating
   that they're capital letters rather than lower-case ones.
 * 17 more small capital letters are now available at their
   Unicode code points:
   - U+1D00 LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL A
   - U+1D04 LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL C
   - U+1D05 LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL D
   - U+1D07 LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL E
   - U+1D0A LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL J
   - U+1D0B LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL K

   - U+1D22 LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL Z
   - U+A730 LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL F
   - U+A731 LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL S
   - U+A7AF LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL Q
 * U+1E9E LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S now has a 'c2sc' lookup.
 * Mosaic graphics glyphs are no longer hinted.  This should avoid
   embarrassing gaps between adjacent glyphs.
 * Mosaic graphics characters are now encoded at their official
   Unicode code points.  The ZVBI-compatible private-use code points
   will be retained for compatibility.
 * Since Unicode doesn't have a way to represent separated graphics,
   the 'ss16' OpenType feature is used to enable them.
 * Three characters have been unified with the corresponding 6-cell
   mosaic graphics characters and their glyph designs have changed
   accordingly:
   - U+2588 FULL BLOCK (block)
   - U+258C LEFT HALF BLOCK (lfblock)
   - U+2590 RIGHT HALF BLOCK (rtblock)
 * Two other glyphs have been updated to align with those:
   - U+2580 UPPER HALF BLOCK (upblock)
   - U+2584 LOWER HALF BLOCK (dnblock)
 * There are 114 new glyphs:
   - U+01E2 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER AE WITH MACRON
