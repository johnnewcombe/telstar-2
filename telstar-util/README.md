# Telstar API Utility


## Features Under Consideration

* Add support to filtering out dynamic frames
* Add a 'get-page' command
* Report/Clean database command, i.e. remove orphaned frames e.g 123c when there is no 123b. Check for duplicate frames in the database. This shouldn't occur unless frames have been added directly into the database rather than through the API.
